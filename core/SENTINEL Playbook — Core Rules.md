# SENTINEL: PLAYBOOK

**Version 1.0 (Core Rules Locked)**
These rules are stable. Future changes will be proposed and tested in a separate working draft before inclusion in any later version.

**Tactical TTRPG for Applied Mythology**\
Design goal: accessible, choice-driven, narratively grounded. Choices define character more than stats.

---

## PART I — ORIENTATION

### What This Game Is

SENTINEL is a tactical tabletop role‑playing game set in the SENTINEL universe. Players navigate political tension, ethical tradeoffs, and survival under fractured systems. Success is measured in outcomes, relationships, and consequences rather than raw power.

**Not about:**

- min‑max optimization
- combat dominance
- binary morality

**About:**

- navigating competing truths
- sustaining integrity under pressure
- relationships as resources
- choosing consequences you can live with

Core loop: **Investigation → Interpretation → Choice → Consequence**.

---

## PART II — BUILDING A CHARACTER

*Quick note for Step 4 (Establishing Moment): this can be just a single line, for example:* *“I left someone behind and never forgave myself.”*

### Step 1: Background (Professional Identity)

Choose a professional background. It grants fixed expertise and starting tools.

- **Intel Operative** — Systems, Surveillance, Stealth
- **Medic/Field Surgeon** — Triage, Biology, Persuasion
- **Engineer/Technician** — Repair, Infrastructure, Hacking
- **Negotiator/Diplomat** — Persuasion, Reading People, Languages
- **Scavenger/Salvager** — Resource Location, Improvisation, Barter
- **Combat Specialist** — Tactics, Firearms, Conditioning

> Backgrounds express capability, not destiny. They do not create “optimal builds.”

### Step 2: Faction Affiliation

- **Aligned:** Start Friendly with one faction, Unfriendly with its opposite.
- **Neutral:** Start Neutral with all factions; harder early, flexible long‑term.

### Step 3: Resources

- Credits: **500**
- Pistachio Reserves: **100%** (social energy)
- Gear: Background loadout + two items under 200 credits

### Step 4: Establishing Moment (Optional)

One past decision that defines who you are. No mechanics. Pure narrative anchor.

---

## PART III — CORE MECHANICS

### Resolution System

Roll **d20 + Expertise (+5)** when trained.\
DC 10 Standard • 14 Challenging • 18 Difficult • 22 Near‑Impossible.\
Advantage/Disadvantage: roll two d20, take higher/lower.

### Social Energy (Customizable Track)

**Design Intent (read first):** This track exists to validate limits, not punish players. It helps the table decide *when to step back, hand off, or wait* instead of forcing constant social performance. It should always feel humane, story-driven, and optional to personalize. Only then do the numbers below matter.

This track measures the character’s emotional bandwidth for interaction, negotiation, and conflict navigation. It is deliberately **fiction‑first** and customizable to match tone.

Name it to fit the character or table theme: **Pistachios, Battery, Bandwidth, Spoons, Focus Meter, Social Fuel**, etc.

#### Starting Value

100% at the beginning of each mission (unless narrative events say otherwise).

#### Depletion (choose what fits the scene)

- Brief interaction (gate check, quick ask): **–5%**
- Sustained conversation or negotiation: **–10%**
- High‑stakes pressure (interrogation, moral dilemma, intense debate): **–15%**
- Extended people‑time: **–5% per hour**
- Multiple stressors stacked: apply the **highest** cost, not all costs

> GM Guidance: Deplete the track when the scene *demands presence*, not just when someone talks.

#### Restoration

- Solitary work (research, surveillance, tinkering): **+5% per hour**
- Quiet grounding ritual (journaling, music, prayer, meditation, pacing): **+5–10%**
- Mission end: **reset to 100%**

#### Effects by Range

- **51–100 (Centered):** Normal performance
- **26–50 (Frayed):** Disadvantage on social rolls
- **1–25 (Overloaded):** Disadvantage on all interpersonal actions
- **0 (Shut Down):** Complex social interactions automatically fail; character needs time/space

#### Active Option: Tactical Reset

Once per scene, the player may describe a brief reset ritual (snack, walk, breathing, stepping outside).

- **Cost:** –10% social energy
- **Effect:** Advantage on the next social roll

> Resets are short. If the table asks, “Do we pause the mission?” it’s too big a ritual.

---

### Customization Toolkit

Use this to reskin the track without changing the math.

**Step 1: Name the Track**\
Pick language that reflects the character’s worldview. Examples:

- "Pistachios" (light, playful)
- "Battery" (tech‑forward)
- "Grace" (faith‑inflected)
- "Composure" (discipline‑focused)

**Step 2: Define the Reset Ritual**\
Each character names one reliable reset (tea, sketching, tuning gear, stretching, mantra). It shapes roleplay.

**Step 3: Add One Personal Trigger**\
Choose one situation that drains extra energy for this character (crowds, being lied to, violence nearby, moral hypocrisy). When triggered, increase the cost of that scene by **+5%**.

**Step 4: Add One Sanctuary**\
Pick a context where restoration happens more easily (libraries, workshops, quiet rooftops, kitchens). Being there grants **+5%** extra on recovery scenes.

> These custom elements never punish creativity; they deepen characterization.

---

### Design Intent

Social energy validates real limits. It creates tactical decisions like:

- push through conversation or step out?
- delegate to another character?
- negotiate later when you’re centered?

It should feel humane, not punitive.

---

### Reputation System

**Player note:** You don’t track factions globally. Only relationships that change because of you.

Each faction tracks you independently: Hostile → Unfriendly → Neutral → Friendly → Allied.\
Help +1 • oppose −1 • betray −2+ • Hinge Moments may lock states.

### Hinge Moments

Irreversible choices that define identity. No mechanical rewards. Permanent narrative gravity. Future missions reference them.

> Examples live in the Mission Appendix (not in the rules text).

### Enhancements (Temptation Mechanics)

Factions offer power at structural cost. Benefits are real; leverage is permanent. Accepting trades agency for capability. Refusing preserves autonomy and difficulty.

---

## PART IV — EQUIPMENT & ENHANCEMENTS

This section describes **tools the team can buy** and **offers that change who they answer to.**

Equipment improves tactics. Enhancements reshape obligations. Neither turns the game into a power treadmill.

---

### EQUIPMENT CATEGORIES (Buyable, Swappable)

Prices assume typical post‑collapse markets; tables are guides, not prisons.

#### Surveillance

- **Tactical Drone (300)**: remote recon.\
  Upgrades: Stealth Coating (+200, advantage on stealth), Extended Battery (+150), Advanced Sensors (+250, detect electronics/heat through barriers).
- **A/V Recorders (50–200)**: hidden cameras, direction mics; encrypted storage.
- **Motion Tracker (150)**: detects movement through walls at short range.

#### Hacking

- **Encryption Breaker (400)**: single‑use, advantage vs high‑security systems.
- **Ghost Protocol Suite (300)**: scrubs logs and traces.
- **Network Mapper (200)**: visual map of vulnerabilities and hidden routes.

#### Infiltration

- **Lockpick Set (100)**: advantage vs mechanical locks.
- **Climbing Rig (200)**: vertical access, pro‑grade safety.
- **Disguise Module (300)**: temp identity tools, advantage on deception.

#### Non‑Lethal Combat

- **EMP Device (500)**: disables electronics/synthetics in a radius.
- **Neural Disruptor (400)**: close‑range incapacitation.
- **Stun Grenade (50)**: flashbang effect; crowd control.

#### Medical

- **Trauma Kit (200)**: stabilize critical injury; single‑use.
- **Diagnostic Scanner (350)**: detect injury, toxins, implants.
- **Stimulant Dose (100)**: one‑time physical boost; addiction risk.

#### Communications

- **Encrypted Comms (250)**: secure voice/text.
- **Long‑Range Transmitter (400)**: remote contact; high power signature.
- **Translator Module (150)**: real‑time language bridge.

> **Guiding principle:** gear grants *advantages in moments*, not permanent stat growth.

---

### UPGRADE ECONOMY

- **Mission Rewards:** 200–500 (basic), 500–1000 (complex), 1000+ (high risk).
- **Credits CAN buy:** gear, intel, contacts, safe houses, limited black‑market access.
- **Credits CANNOT buy:** core stats, reputation, or outcomes of Hinge Moments.

---

### ENHANCEMENTS (Temptations with Strings)

**Refusing enhancements is not a punishment path.**

These offers provide real power at structural cost. Accepting one creates a persistent narrative lever other factions may try to pull.

> GMs: **Pressure, not coercion.** Make benefits tempting, not mandatory.

#### Ember Colonies

- **Resilience Protocol:** +2 survival/endurance.\
  Cost: monthly clinic visits. Surveillance-lite ideology.
- **Community Network:** advantage on Ember reputation.\
  Cost: location tracking and social expectations.

#### Nexus

- **AI Assistant Implant:** advantage on hacking/analysis.\
  Cost: reports activity to Nexus.
- **Predictive Analytics:** faster tactical calls.\
  Cost: always-on network dependency.

#### Lattice

- **Neural Reflex Optimization:** +2 combat/reaction.\
  Cost: quarterly maintenance, creeping oversight.
- **Metabolic Tuning:** social energy drains 50% slower.\
  Cost: continuous biometric monitoring.

#### Convergence

- **Backup Protocol:** death becomes recoverable.\
  Cost: identity ambiguity.
- **Memory Palace:** perfect recall.\
  Cost: shared access to memories.

#### Architects

- **Authority Credentials:** leadership advantage.\
  Cost: protocol compliance.
- **Infrastructure Access:** logistics advantage.\
  Cost: usage rationed and logged.

#### Witnesses

- **Observer Protocol:** stealth/info advantage.\
  Cost: strict neutrality limits action.
- **Archive Access:** research advantage.\
  Cost: all queries recorded.

#### Covenant

- **Circle of Trust:** advantage on social rolls within Covenant communities.\
  Cost: attendance obligations, public adherence to doctrine.
- **Sanctuary Rights:** access to safe houses and healing.\
  Cost: tithing, expected to shelter others in turn.

#### Steel Syndicate

- **Supply Line Access:** advantage on acquisition/barter rolls.\
  Cost: debts accrue interest; they always collect.
- **Syndicate Protection:** muscle when you need it.\
  Cost: "favors" that escalate over time.

#### Ghost Networks

- **Clean Identity:** advantage on deception; a fresh start.\
  Cost: your old identity is leverage; they own your secret.
- **Dead Drop Network:** intel and escape routes.\
  Cost: you run jobs for them; deniability means they'll disavow you.

#### Wanderers

> Wanderers don't offer enhancements. Their philosophy resists permanent ties—they help, share what they know, and move on. You can't owe a debt to someone who won't stay.

#### Cultivators

> Cultivators don't offer enhancements. They see augmentation as part of the problem—another way systems claim ownership of bodies. They'll teach you to live without dependencies, not create new ones.

---

### DECISION FRAMEWORK (Table Tool)

When an enhancement is offered, pause and ask:

- What short‑term power does it grant?
- What long‑term freedom does it trade away?
- How does this change the character’s identity?
- Who now has leverage over them?

**GM Use:**

- let consequences bloom over time
- turn dependencies into plot hooks, not punishments
- escalate pressure ethically, not mechanically

---

*This unified catalog replaces older equipment lists and the enhancement booklet. If a legacy item isn’t listed, reskin something here or negotiate a fair price/fictional tradeoff.*

---

## PART V — MISSIONS & CAMPAIGNS

### Mission Flow

Briefing → Planning → Execution → Resolution → Debrief.

*Tiny anchors for new players:*

- **Briefing:** What’s wrong and who’s asking. *"The clinic can’t get supplies across the bridge."*
- **Planning:** Decide approach and roles. *"We’ll scout first, then negotiate with the foreman."*
- **Execution:** The plan meets reality. *"The logs don’t match and someone’s lying."*
- **Resolution:** The situation settles for now. *"Supplies arrived, but Ember is suspicious now."*
- **Debrief:** We name the consequences. *"We kept people safe, but strained a faction."*

### Mission Types

Investigation • Rescue/Extraction • Diplomacy • Sabotage/Disruption • Escort/Protection.

### Campaign Phases (Framework)

Recommended structure, not canon:

1. **Pattern of Failures** — small anomalies expose systemic tension.
2. **Eyes Everywhere** — you know you’re being watched; trust becomes tactical.
3. **Who Gets to Decide** — truth forces irreversible ideological choices.

> Scenario examples are templates, not predetermined canon.

---

### Debrief (After Every Mission)

*Debrief takes 5–10 minutes, not a meeting.*

Turn events into meaning. Keep it short.

**Prompts (pick 2–3):**

- What did this mission cost?
- Who benefited unexpectedly?
- Which relationship changed?
- What question did this create?

**Mechanical wrap‑up:**

- reset social energy (unless fiction prevents it)
- apply reputation shifts
- pay rewards / note costs
- log Hinge Moments (if any)
- update obligations from enhancements

> Debrief = reflection, not scoring. One page, tops.

---

## Mission Examples

**These are templates. Your table is canon.** (Templates, not Canon)

Each mission is designed so that **all choices are defensible** and consequences ripple forward.

---

### PHASE 1: Pattern of Failures

#### 1) **Harvest Run Diagnostics** (Investigation)

A farming cooperative loses crop yields with no clear cause. The data suggests operator error, but sabotage remains possible.

- **Complications:** tired workers hiding mistakes, conflicting logs, a constructor unit that won’t cooperate.
- **Pressure:** hungry community needs answers fast.
- **Hinge-style fork:** expose human error publicly, shield the workers, or blame the machines.

#### 2) **The Broken Bridge** (Rescue/Logistics)

A collapsed transit span isolates a clinic. The community wants help, factions want leverage.

- **Complications:** unsafe structure, limited time, offers of faction “assistance.”
- **Pressure:** every delay costs lives.
- **Tradeoff:** accept fast help with strings, or solve slower on your own terms.

#### 3) **Quiet Frequency** (Diplomacy/Tech)

A small town jams AI sensors to feel “free,” but the interference disrupts regional communications.

- **Complications:** locals feel surveilled, Nexus wants compliance, nearby settlements need the network.
- **Choice:** restore full coverage, negotiate limited zones, or help them build consent-based protocols.

---

### PHASE 2: Eyes Everywhere

#### 4) **Ghost Credentials** (Infiltration/Trust)

Forged ID tags appear in multiple territories, all linked to your team.

- **Complications:** you look guilty, every faction is jumpy, logs don’t match reality.
- **Pressure:** prove innocence without exposing allies.
- **Dilemma:** burn a contact, implicate a faction, or stay quiet and track the forger.

#### 5) **The Conference Table** (Diplomacy)

A multi‑faction summit requests a neutral facilitator. Everyone records everything.

- **Complications:** misinformation spreads faster than facts.
- **Pressure:** one outburst collapses negotiations.
- **Fork:** correct lies publicly, correct privately, or let a lie stand for stability.

#### 6) **Redacted** (Investigation/Archivist)

Witness archives show events you personally remember… differently.

- **Complications:** archivists won’t alter records without proof, someone benefits from the rewrite.
- **Choice:** challenge the archives, accept the record, or investigate who edits history and why.

---

### PHASE 3: Who Gets to Decide

#### 7) **The Optimization Plan** (Ethics/Policy)

A coalition proposes centralized rationing to prevent collapse.

- **Complications:** it will save lives and also reduce autonomy.
- **Pressure:** scarcity timeline is real.
- **Decision:** endorse, sabotage, or propose messy distributed alternatives.

#### 8) **The Protector** (Conflict/Philosophy)

A charismatic leader (human or synthetic) promises safety if given emergency authority.

- **Complications:** communities want relief; critics fear precedent.
- **Fork:** legitimize them, constrain them, or remove them… publicly or quietly.

#### 9) **Lines on the Map** (Diplomacy/Governance)

Factions propose new borders and neutral zones.

- **Complications:** who moves, who stays, who loses home.
- **Outcome space:** negotiated coexistence, enforced partition, or living with ambiguity.

> Endings are structural: every solution stabilizes something while breaking something else.

---



## PART VI — GAME MASTER GUIDANCE

Keep the table oriented by principles instead of procedures. When in doubt, choose clarity over cleverness.

- Present dilemmas with legitimacy on all sides
- Honor social energy depletion in fiction
- Make NPCs complicated, not theatrical
- Reward thoughtful choices over optimized ones
- Use scaffolding (options, prompts) without railroading

> This section intentionally stays short. The Advanced GM Resources expand these ideas when you want depth.

---

## PART VII — PLAYER RESOURCES

*This is the cheat sheet you reference mid-session.*

Character sheet tracks: Background • Affiliation • Credits • Pistachios • Gear • Reputation • Hinge Moments • Enhancements.

Between missions: Rest • Shop • Research • Social scenes.

---

## PART VII-A — PLAYER CHRONICLE TEMPLATE

*Don’t overdo it. Bullet points beat essays.* (Copy for your table)

This document is the **player-owned canon** for a campaign. It records what changed because of *your* choices.

> Keep it short, honest, and living. This is history from your perspective.

---

### 1) Characters Who Matter

NPCs we interacted with and what changed between us.

| Name | First Impression | Current Relationship | Notes |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
|      |                  |                      |       |

---

### 2) Faction Status (Our Timeline)

Track only movements that happened because of our actions.

| Faction | Start | Current | What Changed |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | ------------ |
|         |       |         |              |

---

### 3) Mission Outcomes Log

Short summaries. No essays.

| Mission | What We Tried | Result | Immediate Consequence |
| ------- | ------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
|         |               |        |                       |

---

### 4) Hinge Moments Index

Irreversible choices we made.

| Situation | Choice | Why We Chose It | Long-term Ripple |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
|           |        |                 |                  |

---

### 5) Open Questions

Mysteries, contradictions, unresolved tensions.

-
-
-

---

### 6) Consequence Map

Patterns we’re starting to notice.

- "X decision made Y faction nervous"
- "Enhancement offers now come with pressure"
- "Neutrality created opportunity *and* suspicion"

---

> The Chronicle is optional to share in-fiction. NPCs may disagree with your version. That tension is the point.

---

## PLAYER CANON BIBLE

*Subtitle: How Your Campaign Becomes Canon*

Record only what became **permanent**. If it didn’t reshape the world, it belongs in the Chronicle, not here.

**Canon Entry**

```
Event: …
Hinge: …
Change: …
Who Feels It: …
Version: v[X]
```

**Rhythm**

- after missions: update the Chronicle
- after arcs: add Canon entries
- when permanence is obvious: bump version

> Chronicle = what happened. Canon = what stayed changed.

---

## PART VIII — DESIGN APPENDIX

*If you like designer notes, read this. Otherwise skip.*

Why these mechanics exist, how they model autonomy, coercion, and consequence, and guidance for adapting tables, pacing, and tone without breaking the system.

---

**Version note:** Core rules locked for v1.0. Revisions beyond typo fixes belong in the next draft (v1.1).
