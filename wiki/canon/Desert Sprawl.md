# Desert Sprawl

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Southwest — Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico
> **Primary:** [[Ghost Networks]]
> **Contested by:** [[Steel Syndicate]]

---

## Overview

Empty highways, buried bunkers, places to disappear. If you need to not exist for a while, you come here. The desert doesn't ask questions.

The Sprawl is less a territory than an absence—the negative space where other factions can't see.

---

## Character

The Sprawl feels like the world forgot it was here:

- **Empty highways** stretching to heat-shimmer horizons
- **Buried bunkers** from pre-Collapse paranoia
- **Ghost towns** (literal and figurative)
- **Old casino towns** repurposed for less legal commerce

> [!quote] Ghost Network Saying
> "The desert keeps secrets. We just help it remember where they're buried."

## Control Dynamics

### Ghost Networks (Primary)

[[Ghost Networks]] don't hold the Sprawl—they *haunt* it. Safe houses, escape routes, buried caches. You can't control what you can't find.

**Hard borders:** None—Ghosts don't hold territory

**Presence:** Safe houses, smuggling routes, disappearance services

### Steel Syndicate (Contested)

[[Steel Syndicate]] runs black market hubs in old casino towns. They want the Sprawl profitable; the Ghosts want it invisible. Sometimes those goals align.

**Zone of influence:** Black market hubs, gambling operations, resource trade

**Relationship:** Competitive coexistence—different customers, occasional overlap

| Tucson Passages | Smuggling | Routes south and west |
| The Empty Quarter | Wilderness | Where people go to not be found |

---

## Services

The Sprawl offers what other regions won't:

| Service | Provider | Price |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Disappearance** | Ghost Networks | Varies by heat level |
| **Black market goods** | Steel Syndicate | Market rates plus risk premium |
| **Safe passage** | Both | Reputation and payment |
| **Information burial** | Ghost Networks | Favors owed |

> [!warning] Finding the Ghosts
