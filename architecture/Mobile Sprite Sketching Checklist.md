# Mobile Sprite Sketching Checklist (Resprite)

## Session 1: Base Proportions (15-20 min)

**Canvas:** 48x48px, transparent background

**Draw:**
- [ ] Character silhouette at different scales (32px, 48px, 64px)
- [ ] Which size makes gear readable?
- [ ] Mark "feet anchor point" (where shadow sits)
- [ ] Test: can you see individual gear pieces (backpack, laptop case)?

**Export:** `cipher_proportions.png`

## Session 2: Color Palette Test (10-15 min)

**Using Cipher's base colors from style guide:**
- [ ] Draw simple 16x16 color swatches
- [ ] Test readability on dark background (#2a2a2a)
- [ ] Test readability on light background (#c4c4c4)
- [ ] Do grays/browns have enough contrast?
- [ ] Can you distinguish clothing from gear?

**Palette to test:**
```
Body: #4a4a4a
Jacket: #5c5449
Pants: #3d3d3d
Backpack: #4d5357
Skin: #d4a574
Tech accent: #4a90a4
```

**Export:** `palette_test.png`

## Session 3: South-Facing Idle (20-30 min)

**Goal:** One static pose, full detail

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Shadow layer (16x8 oval, gray)
- [ ] Feet planted (wide stance, grounded)
- [ ] Legs (simple columns, slight taper)
- [ ] Torso (add jacket/vest outline)
- [ ] Backpack visible over shoulders
- [ ] Laptop case on left hip
- [ ] Belt pouches on right
- [ ] Arms at sides (relaxed, not T-pose)
- [ ] Head (8x8, centered)
- [ ] Minimal face (eyes + nose suggestion)
- [ ] Temple scars (2px each side)

**Test questions:**
- [ ] Is posture "quiet" not aggressive?
- [ ] Can you identify 3+ gear pieces?
- [ ] Does it read as "tactical/practical"?

**Export:** `cipher_south_idle.png`

## Session 4: Directional Facings (20-30 min)

**Draw simplified versions (no animation):**

**East (profile right):**
- [ ] Single eye visible
- [ ] Backpack on left shoulder
- [ ] Laptop case on front hip
- [ ] Feet in walking stance

**North (back view):**
- [ ] Full backpack visible
- [ ] Back of head (hair/hood silhouette)
- [ ] Shoulders squared
- [ ] No face

**West (profile left):**
- [ ] Just mirror East for now
- [ ] Or note: "flip East horizontally"

**Export:** `cipher_facings.png` (all 4 in one image)

## Session 5: Faction Variants (15 min each)

**Pick 2 factions to test:**

**Syndicate Enforcer:**
- [ ] Same body base as Cipher
- [ ] Swap head: helmet/visor instead of bare
- [ ] Swap gear: heavier armor plates
- [ ] Swap colors: browns (#5a4a3a) + rust (#8b4513)

**Ember Scout:**
- [ ] Same body base
- [ ] Swap head: hood instead of bare
- [ ] Swap gear: more pockets, patches
- [ ] Swap colors: earth tones (#6b5d4f) + faded fabric (#8a6f47)

**Test:** Can you tell them apart at a glance?

**Export:** `faction_variants.png`

## Session 6: Animation Frame Sketch (Optional, 15 min)

**Don't animate - just draw keyframes:**

**Walk cycle south (4 frames):**
- [ ] Frame 1: Left foot forward
- [ ] Frame 2: Both feet down
- [ ] Frame 3: Right foot forward
- [ ] Frame 4: Both feet down

**Notes:**
- Keep torso/head mostly stable
- Only legs + slight arm swing change
- Mark "which pixels move" vs "which stay static"

**Export:** `walk_frames_rough.png`

## Final Export Bundle

**Before leaving Resprite, export:**
- [ ] All sketches as individual PNGs
- [ ] One combined reference sheet
- [ ] Color palette as text notes (hex codes)

**Organize folder:**
```

## Questions to Answer

**Before starting Aseprite work, you should know:**

1. **Scale:** Does 48x48 feel right, or go bigger/smaller?
2. **Detail level:** Can you read gear at this size?
3. **Palette:** Do colors have enough contrast?
4. **Silhouette:** Can you identify character from outline alone?
5. **Modularity:** Can you swap parts easily (head, gear)?
6. **Facing:** Which direction feels most readable?

**Write answers in notes.txt - they'll guide Aseprite session**

**Estimated total mobile time:** 1.5-2 hours spread across work breaks
