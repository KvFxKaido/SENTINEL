# Post-Collapse North America

The continent fractured along infrastructure lines. Where power still flows, Lattice holds. Where it doesn't, others fill the vacuum.

## Regions

### The Rust Corridor
**Great Lakes industrial belt — Detroit to Pittsburgh**

- **Primary influence:** Lattice
- **Contested by:** Steel Syndicate
- **Character:** Rusted factories, salvage economies, flickering power grids. Lattice keeps the lights on, but Syndicate controls what moves in the dark.
- **Hard border:** Lattice checkpoints at functioning power substations
- **Zone of influence:** Syndicate runs the scrap trade, protection rackets

---

### Appalachian Hollows
**Mountain communities from Georgia to Pennsylvania**

- **Primary influence:** Ember Colonies
- **Contested by:** Cultivators
- **Character:** Insular survivor settlements in valleys and old coal towns. They remember the Collapse viscerally. Outsiders earn trust slowly or not at all.
- **Hard border:** Mountain passes, fortified hollers
- **Zone of influence:** Cultivators trade seeds and remedies along the ridgelines

---

### The Gulf Passage
**Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida**

- **Primary influence:** Wanderers
- **Contested by:** Ghost Networks
- **Character:** Trade routes through flooded cities and coastal ruins. What the hurricanes didn't take, the Collapse did. Now it's a smuggler's paradise.
- **Hard border:** None — fluid territory
- **Zone of influence:** Ghost Networks maintain safe houses and escape routes along the coast

---

### The Breadbasket
**Great Plains — Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas**

- **Primary influence:** Cultivators
- **Contested by:** Wanderers
- **Character:** Reclaimed farmland, seed vaults, agrarian communes. The Collapse starved the cities; the Cultivators made sure it wouldn't happen again.
- **Hard border:** Defended granaries and water sources
- **Zone of influence:** Wanderers run trade caravans to and from the coasts

---

### The Northern Reaches
**Former Canada — Ontario to Alberta**

- **Primary influence:** Covenant
- **Contested by:** Ember Colonies
- **Character:** Cold, sparse, principled. The Covenant established sanctuaries in the north where oaths still mean something. Harsh winters enforce honesty.
- **Hard border:** Covenant-sworn settlements with strict entry protocols
- **Zone of influence:** Ember survivors drift north when the south gets too hot

---

### The Pacific Corridor
**West Coast — Seattle to San Diego**

- **Primary influence:** Convergence
- **Contested by:** Architects
- **Character:** Tech graveyards and enhancement clinics built in the bones of Silicon Valley. The future lives here, bolted onto flesh.
- **Hard border:** Convergence-controlled medical facilities and research compounds
- **Zone of influence:** Architects maintain claims on pre-Collapse IP and infrastructure records

---

### The Desert Sprawl
**Southwest — Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico**

- **Primary influence:** Ghost Networks
- **Contested by:** Steel Syndicate
- **Character:** Empty highways, buried bunkers, places to disappear. If you need to not exist for a while, you come here.
- **Hard border:** None — Ghost Networks don't hold territory, they haunt it
- **Zone of influence:** Syndicate runs black market hubs in old casino towns

---

### The Northeast Scar
**Boston to Washington D.C.**

- **Primary influence:** Architects
- **Contested by:** Nexus
- **Character:** The old power centers, now crumbling monuments to what was. Architects dig through records; Nexus watches everything from the infrastructure that still works.
- **Hard border:** Architect-claimed archives, museums, government facilities
- **Zone of influence:** Nexus surveillance networks blanket the entire corridor

---

### The Sovereign South
**Deep South — Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana interior**

- **Primary influence:** Witnesses
- **Contested by:** Covenant
- **Character:** Oral histories and written records preserved in church basements and old courthouses. The Witnesses remember what really happened, and that makes them dangerous.
- **Hard border:** Archive sites with sworn keepers
- **Zone of influence:** Covenant has sanctuary agreements in several towns

---

### The Texas Spine
**Central Texas corridor — San Antonio to Dallas**

- **Primary influence:** Steel Syndicate
- **Contested by:** Lattice
- **Character:** Oil infrastructure, weapons manufacturing, raw capitalism. The Syndicate turned scarcity into profit and hasn't stopped.
- **Hard border:** Syndicate-controlled refineries and trade posts
- **Zone of influence:** Lattice maintains precarious power-sharing agreements

---

### The Frozen Edge
**Alaska and the Yukon**

- **Primary influence:** Ember Colonies
- **Contested by:** None (too remote)
- **Character:** The last true frontier. Survivors who wanted nothing to do with faction politics came here. They endure.
- **Hard border:** Geography itself
- **Zone of influence:** Minimal — occasional Wanderer traders

---

## Nexus

Nexus doesn't hold territory — they hold information. Their presence is felt everywhere through:
- Surveillance networks in urban ruins
- Information brokers in every major settlement
- Predictive systems that know what's coming before it arrives

Their influence is a zone, never a border. Where there's infrastructure, Nexus is watching.

## Notes

- **Overlapping claims emerge in play** — These are starting positions. Player actions shift influence.
- **Hard borders are enforceable** — Factions invest resources to hold them.
- **Zones of influence are negotiable** — Presence without control. Soft power.
- **Uninhabited zones exist** — Radiation, contamination, or just too damaged to matter. Not every hex is claimed.
