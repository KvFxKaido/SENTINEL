# Texas Spine

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Central Texas corridor — San Antonio to Dallas
> **Primary:** [[Steel Syndicate]]
> **Contested by:** [[Lattice]]

---

## Overview

Oil infrastructure, weapons manufacturing, raw capitalism. The [[Steel Syndicate]] turned scarcity into profit and hasn't stopped. If it moves, burns, or kills, the Spine probably made it.

This is where resources become power and power becomes money.

---

## Character

The Spine feels like a machine that runs on ambition:

- **Refineries** processing whatever fuel sources remain
- **Manufacturing plants** producing weapons and tools
- **Trade posts** where everything has a price
- **Armed convoys** moving goods under Syndicate protection

> [!quote] Syndicate Saying
> "Everyone needs something. We make sure it costs them."

## Control Dynamics

### Steel Syndicate (Primary)

[[Steel Syndicate]] controls the resources that keep post-Collapse civilization running: fuel, weapons, manufactured goods. They don't govern—they profit.

**Hard borders:** Syndicate-controlled refineries and trade posts

**Leverage:** Resource dependency; cross them and supplies stop

### Lattice (Contested)

[[Lattice]] maintains precarious power-sharing agreements. They need Syndicate resources; Syndicate needs Lattice power infrastructure. Neither trusts the other.

**Zone of influence:** Power grid nodes, technical maintenance

**Relationship:** Mutual dependency, mutual suspicion

## Industry

The Spine produces:

| Product | Scale | Control |

| **Fuel** | Regional supply | Syndicate monopoly |
| **Weapons** | Major exporter | Syndicate manufacturing |
| **Vehicles** | Limited production | Syndicate/Lattice joint |
| **Power** | Grid dependent | Lattice operation, Syndicate resources |

> [!important] The Fuel Leverage
> Whoever controls fuel controls transportation. Whoever controls transportation controls trade. The Syndicate understands this perfectly.

---

## Business Culture

The Spine runs on deals:

| Rule | Meaning |

| **Contracts are sacred** | Break a deal, lose everything |
| **Reputation is currency** | Your word is your credit |
| **Results matter** | Ideology is for people who can afford it |
| **Everyone pays** | No exceptions, no charity |
