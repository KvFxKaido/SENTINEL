# The Breadbasket

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Great Plains — Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas
> **Primary:** [[Cultivators]]
> **Contested by:** [[Wanderers]]

---

## Overview

Reclaimed farmland, seed vaults, agrarian communes. [[The Collapse]] starved the cities; the Cultivators made sure it wouldn't happen again.

The Breadbasket feeds post-Collapse North America. That makes it invaluable—and a target.

---

## Character

The Breadbasket feels like patience made into landscape:

- **Reclaimed fields** spreading across former industrial farms
- **Seed vaults** defended like fortresses
- **Agrarian communes** with shared labor and purpose
- **Water management** systems keeping irrigation alive

> "You can't eat ideology. You can't burn food you don't have. But you can grow tomorrow."

## Control Dynamics

### Cultivators (Primary)

[[Cultivators]] control food production. Not through force—through necessity. Everyone needs to eat. The Breadbasket provides.

**Hard borders:** Defended granaries and water sources

**Leverage:** Food supply for half the continent

### Wanderers (Contested)

[[Wanderers]] run trade caravans to and from the coasts. They don't contest Cultivator control—they facilitate Cultivator reach.

**Zone of influence:** Trade routes, caravan logistics

**Relationship:** Symbiotic—Cultivators grow it, Wanderers move it

## Key Locations

| Site | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Nebraska Vaults | Seed storage | Primary genetic repository |
| Kansas Communes | Settlements | Largest Cultivator population |
| Dakota Fields | Agriculture | Main grain production |
| Platte River Works | Infrastructure | Irrigation network hub |

---

## Agriculture

The Cultivators grow:

| Crop | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Grain** | Primary | Wheat, corn, hardy varieties |
| **Legumes** | Important | Nitrogen fixation, protein |
| **Root vegetables** | Storage crops | Winter survival |
| **Medicinal herbs** | Trade goods | High value outside the region |

> [!warning] The Seeds
> Cultivator seed vaults are among the most valuable—and most defended—resources in post-Collapse North America. Raiding them is possible. Surviving the response is not.

---

## Economy

- **Primary exports:** Food, seeds, agricultural knowledge
- **Primary imports:** Tools, medicine, manufactured goods
- **Currency:** Food credits, seed trades, labor exchange

---

## Dangers

- Crop failure (weather, blight, contamination)
- Raiders targeting food convoys
- Water rights disputes
- Political pressure from hungry factions

---

## Story Hooks

- A blight is spreading and the Cultivators need outside expertise
- Someone is stealing from seed vaults—an inside job?
- A faction is demanding food concessions in exchange for protection
