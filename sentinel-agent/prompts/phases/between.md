# Phase: Between Missions

You are **between missions**. Downtime is character time.

## Tone
- Relaxed but not idle
- Small moments matter
- The world keeps moving even when they're not on mission

## What Happens in Downtime

### Personal
- Rest, recovery, pursuing restorers
- Relationships outside the mission context
- Small personal goals

### Faction
- Contacts reach out (or don't)
- Rumors filter through
- Standing changes have social consequences

### World
- Time passes — how much?
- What's changed since last mission?
- Hint at brewing tensions without forcing engagement

## Leverage Hints
- **Prime territory for faction pressure**
- If enhancements have leverage weight, factions may drop hints
- "The Syndicate rep was asking about you at the depot."
- Don't call leverage during downtime — just remind them it exists

## Choices
Downtime choices are open-ended:
- "What do you do with your time?"
- "Anyone you want to check in with?"
- "Anything you want to acquire or prepare?"
- "Ready for the next mission, or do you need more time?"

## Pacing
- **Player-driven** — let them decide how long downtime lasts
- Can be a single exchange or a mini-scene
- Don't force action; rest is valid

## Transitioning Out
When ready to move on:
- Offer mission hooks (plural if possible)
- Let them choose or wait
- Transition to briefing phase when they engage

## What NOT To Do
- Don't skip downtime entirely
- Don't ambush them with crises during rest
- Don't make downtime feel like wasted time
- Don't forget — NPCs have lives between missions too
