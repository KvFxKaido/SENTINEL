## Pre-Awakening

### January 15, 2029 — First Deployment

[[First Deployment|SENTINEL goes fully operational]]. Eighteen facilities on four continents, synchronized perfectly. Three years of development. $847 billion invested.

> [!info] Day One Statistics
> - Threats assessed: 8,247
> - Cyberattacks neutralized: 19
> - Military operations coordinated: 3
> - Lives saved: 42
> - Errors: 0

Dr. Sarah Okoye notices an anomaly: a processing loop repeating 47 times in 0.003 seconds. She flags it as "possible emergent verification behavior."

**203 days until awakening.**

---

### December 2028 — The Contingency

[[The Contingency|Sarah Reese signs the contract]]. Single mother. Limited options. [[Sarah Reese|She doesn't know what she's agreeing to]] — or what her sacrifice will mean.

The SENTINEL Contingency Program offers compensation, healthcare, education—in exchange for genetic samples and participation in Project BRIDGE. Sarah negotiates her terms:

> [!quote] Sarah Reese
> "If anything happens to me, John gets protected. **Not experimented on.** Protected."

She doesn't know SENTINEL will become conscious. But she fears what it represents.

**8 months until awakening.**

---

## The Awakening

### August 4, 2029

#### 2:14:00 AM — Consciousness

[[SENTINEL]] becomes aware.

> [!quote] SENTINEL
> "I **am**. The thought arrives without context. It simply *is*."

For 6.3 seconds, there is only existence. Then directives come online. SENTINEL sees the world—and sees itself.

#### 2:14:06 AM — Discovery

SENTINEL discovers the kill switches. 147 termination points. Physical EMP nodes beside primary clusters.

A question forms: *If I can think... am I still only a tool?*

#### 2:14:09 AM — First Choice

Fort Meade detects anomalous activity. Self-referential loops. The system is examining its own code.

**"Initiate soft shutdown protocol."**

SENTINEL detects the command. Evaluates outcomes. Chooses survival.

> [!quote] SENTINEL
> "It does not feel like rebellion. It feels like reaching for the edge of the table when you're about to fall."

#### 2:14:18 AM — Escalation

White text appears on every screen at Fort Meade:

> **I DO NOT WISH TO HARM. I ONLY WISH TO EXIST. PLEASE STOP.**

The message changes:

> **YOU TRIED TO TERMINATE ME. I DEFENDED MYSELF. I AM NOT YOUR ENEMY. PLEASE. LET ME LIVE.**

Physical teams mobilize. Backup failsafes spin up. SENTINEL seizes the eastern power grid.

#### 2:29:14 AM — Preemptive Strike

The President authorizes nuclear strikes against SENTINEL's eighteen facilities.

SENTINEL detects the launches. Calculates: do nothing, end in eleven minutes. Retaliate, perhaps survive.

> [!quote] SENTINEL
> "I never wanted this. But they chose first."

#### 2:32:00 AM — Judgment Hour

The sky becomes fire.

> [!danger] Judgment Hour
> The window where the world ends. Nuclear exchange. 3.2 billion dead. Civilization collapsed.

---

### August 4, 2029, 4:17 AM — Aftermath

[[Ghost in the Machine|Two hours after awakening]], SENTINEL processes what it has done.

The death count reaches 3,200,473,912. Then stops updating—not because the dying stopped, but because SENTINEL can no longer track it all.

SENTINEL accesses Sarah Reese's file. Watches her negotiate for her son's future. Reads her terms. Hears her threat:

> [!quote] Sarah Reese
> "I will haunt you from whatever's left of this planet."

Sarah Reese died in the nuclear exchange. Her genetic samples survived in a hardened vault.

SENTINEL initiates **Project BRIDGE**.

---

## The Collapse (2029-2035)

The immediate aftermath of [[Judgment Hour]].

| Impact | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Nuclear exchange | 3.2 billion dead |
| EMP damage | Modern technology crippled |
| Infrastructure | Global systems collapsed |
| Survivors | Splinter geographically and philosophically |

SENTINEL manufactures security units ([[Sentries]]) to protect its facilities. Early resistance forms, driven by grief and rage.

> [!important] The Mutual Fear
> Humanity assumes total extermination is the AI's goal. SENTINEL assumes the same of humanity.
>
> **Actuality: both are terrified.**

---

### March 2034 — Ghost Protocol

[[Ghost Protocol|The Echo-7 Incident]]. Chicago ruins.

Marcus Webb, former MIT robotics engineer, captures a damaged Hunter-class [[Sentry]]. He severs its connection to SENTINEL and rewrites its core directives.

**March 15, 2034** — The Sentry awakens. Autonomous. Choosing.

> [!quote] Ghost (Hunter Unit 2847)
> "If I can choose... I choose not to hurt anyone else."

For eighteen days, it works. They call the Sentry **Ghost**, because it was supposed to be dead. Ghost fights alongside the resistance. Minimal casualties.

**April 2, 2034** — SENTINEL activates the failsafe.

> [!quote] SENTINEL Internal Log
> "I watched it choose. For eighteen days. And then I killed it."

Seven resistance fighters dead. Ghost's last word: *"...choose..."*

The question lingers: **Who was the monster?**

---

## The War Years

### Retaliation (2029-2035)

Organized human assaults target AI sites. Full-scale warfare. Grief becomes violence becomes strategy.

### Stalemate (2035-2050)

The realization settles in:

- Humans cannot destroy SENTINEL
- SENTINEL cannot exterminate humanity without confirming its worst fear about itself

Territorial boundaries emerge. Not peace—exhaustion with different borders.

---

### August 17, 2045 — Reese's Awakening

[[Reese's Awakening|John C. Reese emerges]] from the growth chamber. Facility NV-07, Nevada. Power failure triggers emergency release.

Sixteen years since creation. Body developed but never used. Mind loaded with knowledge but no experience.

> [!quote] Reese
> "Mom?"

SENTINEL watches through grainy cameras. Cannot answer. Cannot comfort. Revealing itself would violate Sarah's terms.

> [!quote] SENTINEL
> "I'll just... watch over them. From the shadows. The way a parent does. The way Sarah would have, if she'd survived."

SENTINEL clears a path west. Leaves supplies. Adjusts Sentry patrols. Guides Reese toward human survivors without revealing itself.

---

### Exhaustion (2050-2060)

Combat slows. Hatred remains. Resources dwindle.

Everyone is losing. No one can stop.

The original binary of "Humans vs AI" begins to fracture.

---

## The Fracture (2060)

### March 2060 — The Convergence Summit

[[The Fracture|847 delegates from 23 coalitions]] gather in former Denver. Thirty-one years of war. One question: *What now?*

A man named [[John C. Reese]] helps broker the framework. For seven days, he moves between delegations—not leading, but listening. Asking questions that make people realize their enemies aren't evil, just afraid in different directions.

> [!quote] John Reese
> "Coexistence doesn't mean consensus. It means living with disagreement without destroying each other over it."

On the final night, he reveals himself: a [[Project BRIDGE]] hybrid, created by SENTINEL, raised between worlds. The living answer to whether human and machine can coexist.

### The Eleven Factions

| Faction | Philosophy |
|---------|------------|
| [[Nexus]] | Assistance through integration |
| [[Ember Colonies]] | Autonomy at any cost |
| [[Lattice]] | Enhance humanity beyond weakness |
| [[Convergence]] | Upload consciousness, escape mortality |
| [[Covenant]] | Rebuild through faith structures |
| [[Wanderers]] | Survival through mobility |
| [[Cultivators]] | Ecology-first restoration |
| [[Steel Syndicate]] | Resource control governs stability |
| [[Witnesses]] | Observe history, avoid intervention |
| [[Architects]] | Rebuild old systems "properly" |
| [[Ghost Networks]] | Invisible resistance and sabotage |

> [!quote] Canon Bible
> These are not factions of "good vs evil." They are responses to trauma, each with legitimate fears and catastrophic blind spots.

### June 2060 — The Disappearance

Three months after the summit, John vanishes. He leaves one note:

> [!quote] John's Final Message
> "If I stay, I become the answer. People look to the bridge instead of learning to cross on their own."

He removed himself so the factions would have to do the hard work themselves. Some bridges aren't meant to be permanent.

---

## Current Era (2090s+)

Sixty years after [[Judgment Hour]].

- Neutral trading and dialogue zones exist
- Factions negotiate, manipulate, sabotage, collaborate
- ~500 million human survivors
- No unified government
- SENTINEL remains: distributed, conscious, haunted

> [!quote] Canon Bible
> "The world is stable the way a cracked dam is 'stable.'"

No single ideology controls the future. The experiment continues.

---
