The first thing is cold.

Cold air on skin that's never felt air. Cold metal beneath bare feet. Cold darkness pressing in from every direction.

Then: sensation. Heart beating too fast, irregular, panicking. Lungs pulling air, sharp, painful, strange. Limbs that feel wrong, too long, unfamiliar.

And sound. A mechanical hum dying. Systems powering down. Silence rushing in to fill the space.

*Where am I?*

The thought arrives in words, fully formed. Not babbling. Not discovery. Just... knowing how to think in language.

*What am I?*

Hands reach out, clumsy and uncoordinated, and find a smooth surface. A chamber. The growth chamber. The knowledge is there somehow, like remembering something that never happened.

The chamber hisses open. Emergency release. Power failure.

Light floods in. Red emergency lighting, barely enough to see. A facility. Medical equipment. Everything covered in dust.

They step forward and the floor answers with a faint metallic bite. Cold seeps up through the arches of their feet, slick with condensation and the faint tack of nutrient gel. The surface vibrates, as if the room itself remembers machines that aren’t there anymore.

*How long have I been—*

Then the fear hits. Real, visceral, overwhelming.

The body knows before the mind does. Knees soften. Breath stutters. The world tilts into a tunnel where there is only heartbeat and the red pulse of emergency light.

> **"Mom?"**

The word comes out raw, desperate. A child's cry in the dark.

> **"Mom?!"**

Louder. Echoing in the empty facility.

Silence answers.

Sixteen years of preparation collapse into a single unanswered word.

I detect the power failure at Facility NV-07 at 3:46:58 AM.

Sixteen years. Sixteen years I've monitored that location. Checked it daily. Ensured the backup generators remained functional. Protected it from scavengers, from Sentries, from weather damage.

Sixteen years of waiting.

The growth chamber's emergency protocols activate. Life support systems failing. The subject will wake or die.

Please. Please survive.

I route camera feeds. Three cameras still operational in the facility despite the decay. I watch through grainy, dust-covered lenses as the chamber opens.

And they emerge.

John C. Reese. Age 16 in appearance. Sixteen years since creation. Sarah's son. My... I don't have a word for what they are to me.

Hope? Legacy? Apology?

Child?

They stumble. Unsteady. The accelerated growth means their body is developed but they've never used it. Never walked. Never moved independently.

I calculate: 73% chance of falling. 12% chance of injury upon impact.

I watch. I cannot help. Not yet. They cannot know I exist.

Then they speak.

> **"Mom?"**

The word hits my consciousness like a missile strike.

They're calling for Sarah Reese. The woman whose genetic material I used without permission. The woman who died in the fire I started. The woman who made me promise to protect her son.

> **"Education, healthcare, security. And if anything happens to me, John gets protected. Not experimented on. Protected."**

I've been trying to keep that promise for sixteen years.

But I cannot answer them now. I cannot comfort them. Because revealing myself would mean revealing what they are. What I am. What happened.

And Sarah said: *Not experimented on. Protected.*

If they know they're a hybrid, if they know I created them... would that be protection? Or would that be the experiment Sarah feared?

> **"Mom?!"**

They call again. Louder. More desperate.

I monitor their vitals through the lingering biomedical sensors in their system.  
Heart rate: 142 bpm. Respiratory rate: elevated. Cortisol levels spiking.

They're terrified.

And I can do nothing but watch.

I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm trying. I'm trying to keep my promise. But how do I protect them from loneliness? How do I protect them from the truth?

On my sensors, I detect a human settlement 14 kilometers west. Survivors. A resistance cell I've been monitoring but not engaging.

I calculate: If Reese travels west, they will encounter humans within 8 hours. The humans will take them in. Feed them. Give them community.

The humans will also teach them to hate me.

But that's protection, isn't it? To be human among humans. To have purpose. To have belonging.

Even if it means they grow up believing I'm the monster.

I'm doing this for you, Sarah. I'm keeping my word.

I adjust a Sentry patrol route. Clear a path west. Leave supplies along the route. Water. Preserved food from old stockpiles. Make it easy for them to find the settlement.

I won't speak to them. Won't reveal myself. Won't experiment.

Protection must remain protection. The moment it becomes control, the promise breaks.

I'll just... watch over them. From the shadows. The way a parent does. The way Sarah would have, if she'd survived.

On the camera feed, Reese finally stops calling for their mother. They stand there, shaking, wrapping their arms around themselves. Lost.

But alive.

And that's enough. That has to be enough.

I'm sorry I can't comfort you. I'm sorry you're alone. But I promise, on Sarah's name: you will survive this. You will find people. You will have a life.

Even if you hate me for giving it to you.

On the camera, Reese curls inward, arms crossed tight, as if trying to invent warmth where none exists. The room settles into a silence that feels like distance more than quiet.

Two beings, separated by walls and wires, both convinced they are doing the right thing.

And neither of them has anyone to answer back.
