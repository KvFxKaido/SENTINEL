# Gulf Passage

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida
> **Primary:** [[Wanderers]]
> **Contested by:** [[Ghost Networks]]

---

## Overview

Trade routes through flooded cities and coastal ruins. What the hurricanes didn't take, [[The Collapse]] did. Now it's a smuggler's paradise.

The Gulf Passage isn't a place you live—it's a place you move through.

---

## Character

The Passage feels like the world forgot to finish drowning it:

- **Flooded cities** with buildings half-submerged
- **Coastal ruins** picked clean and picked again
- **Boat routes** threading through drowned streets
- **Island settlements** on whatever stayed above water

> [!quote] Wanderer Saying
> "The Gulf takes everything eventually. We just borrow it first."

## Control Dynamics

### Wanderers (Primary)

[[Wanderers]] run the trade routes. They know which channels are passable, which ruins are safe, and which captains can be trusted. The Passage is their highway.

**Hard borders:** None—fluid territory by nature

**Control method:** Navigation knowledge and trade relationships

### Ghost Networks (Contested)

[[Ghost Networks]] maintain safe houses and escape routes along the coast. Need to disappear? The Gulf has plenty of places no one looks.

**Zone of influence:** Safe houses, smuggling operations, escape routes

**Relationship:** Professional coexistence—Wanderers move goods, Ghosts move people
