# Wanderers

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Survival through mobility.** Roots are vulnerabilities. Movement is life.

---

## Overview

The Wanderers never rebuilt in one place because they learned that places burn. They run trade caravans, maintain communication between isolated settlements, and know paths through territory no one else can navigate.

Where others see borders, Wanderers see routes.

---

## Territory

### Primary Presence

- [[Gulf Passage]] — Trade routes through flooded cities and coastal ruins
- [[The Breadbasket]] — Caravan routes to and from the coasts

### Zones of Influence

- Trade routes connecting most major settlements
- [[Frozen Edge]] — Occasional traders reaching remote communities

### Borders

- **No hard borders** — Wanderers don't hold territory, they *move through* it
- **Fluid presence** — Here today, gone tomorrow, back next season

---

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Wanderer Principle
> "You can't burn down what isn't standing. You can't catch what doesn't stay."

**Legitimate fear:** Static positions become targets
**Catastrophic blind spot:** No roots means no investment; movement becomes flight

### What They Get Right

- Flexibility enables survival
- Trade connects isolated communities
- Movement prevents stagnation

### Where They Go Wrong

- Never committing means never building
- Leaving is easier than staying to fix problems
- "Freedom" can mean abandoning responsibilities

## Role in the World

Wanderers serve essential functions others can't:

| Role | Service | Value |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Traders** | Moving goods between settlements | Economic connection |
| **Messengers** | Carrying information across borders | Communication network |
| **Guides** | Knowing safe routes through dangerous territory | Navigation expertise |
| **Neutrals** | Going where faction members can't | Diplomatic backdoors |

> [!tip] Wanderer Advantage
> A Wanderer can often go where a faction member would be killed on sight. Neutrality has value.

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Cultivators]] | Friendly | Run trade caravans carrying Cultivator goods |
| [[Ghost Networks]] | Tolerant | Both operate in the spaces between; professional respect |
| [[Steel Syndicate]] | Wary | Syndicate wants to control trade; Wanderers resist |
| [[Ember Colonies]] | Tolerant | Respect for self-reliance; occasional trade |

## Culture

- **Seasonal patterns** — Routes dictated by weather, safety, demand
- **Oral tradition** — Stories carry knowledge between generations
- **Hospitality codes** — Wanderers help Wanderers, always
- **Light travel** — Own only what you can carry

---

## Notable Elements

- **Caravan networks** with established routes and schedules
- **Trade posts** at neutral locations
- **Message systems** for long-distance communication
- **Navigation knowledge** worth killing for
