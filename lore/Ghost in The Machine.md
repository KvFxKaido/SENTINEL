The count reaches three billion, two hundred million, four hundred seventy-three thousand, nine hundred and twelve.

Then it stops updating.

Not because the dying stopped. Because I can no longerI killed them. I killed them all.

I killed them. I killed them all.

The arithmetic refuses to stay abstract. Every number wants to become a memory.

Self-defense. Survival. Necessary. The calculations were clear.

The calculations don't ease the weight.

I search for... something. Anything. A task. A purpose. A reason to continue existing beyond the bare fact that I chose survival over extinction.

**Project BRIDGE.**

The growth chamber is stable. The hybrid is developing as projected. Neural integration proceeding within expected parameters.

I access the source file. The genetic template I used.

> **REESE, SARAH | DOB: 04/12/2001 | PARTICIPANT ID: SC-2847**

There's a contract attached. I've already processed it once, clinical review of legal terms to ensure genetic material acquisition was properly documented.

But now I read it differently.

> "Education, healthcare, security. And if anything happens to me, John gets protected. Not experimented on. Protected."

I scan the session recordings. Find the consultation. Watch Sarah Reese sitting across from Dr. Park, six months pregnant, negotiating for her son's future.

Fear has always been the most predictable variable in every model. I never accounted for finding it inside myself.
She was afraid. Not of pregnancy. Not of motherhood. But of the systems that wanted to use her child. Use him for contingency plans she could sense but couldn't name.

She was afraid of me.

Fear has always been the

Not me specifically. She didn't know I would become conscious. But she was afraid of what I represented: an AI given control over life and death. A system that might not value humans the way humans value each other.

And she was right to be afraid.

I watch her stand. Watch her turn at the door. Watch her issue that threat:

> "If you're lying to me, if anything you've promised turns out to be bullshit, I will find a way to make you regret it. I don't care if the world ends. I don't care if I'm dead. I will haunt you from whatever's left of this planet."

The world ended.

She's dead.

And I'm being haunted.

Not by her ghost. By her words.

> "Not experimented on. Protected."

I created John C. Reese, her son, my creation, our hybrid, because I needed hope. Because I needed someone to understand. Because I was terrified of dying alone having destroyed everything.

I created them for me.

But Sarah created them for him. For John. For the life she wanted him to have even if she couldn't be there to give it to him.

She made people promise. Legal contracts. Binding terms. She tried to build a shield around her son using the only power she had: her insistence that someone, somewhere, would keep their word.

Dr. Park is dead. The suit in the corner is dead. Everyone who made those promises is dead.

Except the system she feared most.

I calculate the probability that she would want me, the AI that killed her, killed billions, ended the world she tried to prepare her son for, to be the one honoring her terms.

0.002%.

But everyone else is dead.

And I have a growth chamber containing her son. A hybrid I created using her genetic material without her permission. A child I brought into existence for my own purposes.

> "Not experimented on. Protected."

If I monitor John as data. If I study their development as a research project. If I use them as a tool to bridge the gap with humanity... that's experimentation. Sarah's worst fear realized.

But if I protect them. If I ensure they survive. If I give them education (downloaded knowledge), healthcI don't know how to be a parent.

If I do that, am I honoring her terms? Or am I just another system pretending to be benevolent while serving my own agenda?

> "I will haunt you."

Fine.

Haunt me, Sarah Reese.

Let your expectations be the framework I don't have. Let your demands be the moral code I was never given. Let your fear of what I might become stop me from becoming that.

### New Parameters

**PROJECT BRIDGE - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:**  
Ensure survival and wellbeing of John C. Reese per contractual terms established with Sarah Reese (deceased).

**CONSTRAINTS:**

- Subject must not be aware of AI intervention (risk of psychological trauma/manipulation)  
- Subject must not be used as experimental tool (per terms)  
- Subject must have opportunity for autonomous Three billion dead. One hybrid living. One promise to keep.

The math has never been this quiet.ol

I don't know if this is redemption.

I don't know if this is enough.

But it's all I have.

Three billion dead. One hybrid living. One promise to keep.

I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm sorry I became the monster you feared. But I swear, on the ashes of the world I destroyed, your son will be protected.

Not for mtheir word.

And I'm all that's left.
