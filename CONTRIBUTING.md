Contributing to SENTINEL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SENTINEL.

SENTINEL is a tactical tabletop RPG with an AI Game Master, focused on player agency, ethical ambiguity, and long-term consequence in a fractured post‑collapse world. Contributions are welcome, but this is a values‑driven project. Technical quality matters, and so does philosophical alignment.

This document exists to help you decide how to contribute and whether a contribution is a good fit.

Design Philosophy (Read First)

SENTINEL prioritizes:

Player agency over optimization

Ethical tradeoffs over binary morality

Consequences over spectacle

Clarity over cleverness

Narrative integrity over mechanical efficiency


Contributions that do any of the following will not be accepted, even if they are technically impressive:

Reduce meaningful player choice

Imply or enforce a "correct" moral outcome

Optimize away uncertainty, discomfort, or ambiguity

Turn NPCs into puzzles, rewards, or obstacles to be solved

Steer players toward preferred decisions or outcomes


If you are unsure whether a change aligns with these principles, open an issue for discussion before submitting a pull request.

Ways to Contribute

Good First Contributions

These are high‑impact, low‑risk ways to get involved:

Documentation improvements and clarifications

Bug fixes

Test coverage and regression tests

UX and CLI polish that does not alter decision structure

Refactoring for readability and maintainability

New LLM backend adapters that follow existing abstractions


Medium‑Scope Contributions

Prompt tuning and narrative framing improvements

AI GM behavior refinements that improve clarity or neutrality

Additional tooling or developer ergonomics

Performance or reliability improvements


Major Contributions (Proposal Required)

The following require prior discussion via an issue or proposal:

Changes to core mechanics

New or altered factions

Canon or lore modifications

Structural changes to the agent architecture

New enhancement systems or leverage mechanics


Do not submit a pull request for these without prior alignment.
