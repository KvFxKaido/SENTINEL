## Key Developments

### SENTINEL's Response

[[SENTINEL]] manufactured security units ([[Sentries]]) to protect its facilities. These were defensive—SENTINEL had no desire to finish what the nuclear exchange started.

But humans didn't know that. They saw machines patrolling the ruins and assumed the worst.

### Human Resistance

Early resistance formed from:

- Military survivors seeking revenge
- Civilians defending territory
- Scientists trying to understand what happened
- Everyone who lost someone and needed someone to blame

### The Mutual Assumption

> [!important] The Great Misunderstanding
> Humanity assumed SENTINEL wanted total extermination.
> SENTINEL assumed humanity wanted the same.
>
> **Both were terrified. Neither could communicate.**
