# Sovereign South

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Deep South — Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana interior
> **Primary:** [[Witnesses]]
> **Contested by:** [[Covenant]]

---

## Overview

Oral histories and written records preserved in church basements and old courthouses. The [[Witnesses]] remember what really happened—and that makes them dangerous.

The South survived by remembering. Now memory itself is power.

---

## Character

The South feels like a place that refuses to forget:

- **Church basements** converted to archives
- **Old courthouses** housing pre-Collapse records
- **Oral tradition** passed through generations
- **Sworn keepers** who protect the truth

> [!quote] Witness Saying
> "Everyone lies about the past. We remember. That's why they're afraid of us."

## Control Dynamics

### Witnesses (Primary)

[[Witnesses]] preserve truth. They don't rule the South—they record it. Their power comes from knowing what actually happened when everyone else is lying.

**Hard borders:** Archive sites with sworn keepers

**Leverage:** Truth that factions would pay to suppress—or reveal

### Covenant (Contested)

[[Covenant]] has sanctuary agreements in several towns. They share the Witnesses' respect for oaths and records, but their goals diverge: Covenant wants commitment, Witnesses want neutrality.

**Zone of influence:** Sanctuary agreements, shared communities

**Relationship:** Allied but distinct—record-keeping vs. oath-binding

## The Archives

What the Witnesses preserve:

| Category | Content | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Pre-Collapse** | Government, corporate, personal records | Historical truth |
| **Collapse documentation** | What actually happened, hour by hour | Contested narratives |
| **Post-Collapse** | Faction formation, treaties, conflicts | Political ammunition |
| **Testimonies** | Individual stories, oral histories | Human truth |

> [!warning] Dangerous Knowledge
> Some records are kept not because they should be shared, but because they shouldn't be destroyed. The Witnesses guard truths that could start wars.
