# Northern Reaches

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Former Canada — Ontario to Alberta
> **Primary:** [[Covenant]]
> **Contested by:** [[Ember Colonies]]

---

## Overview

Cold, sparse, principled. The [[Covenant]] established sanctuaries in the north where oaths still mean something. Harsh winters enforce honesty—you can't survive alone, so promises matter.

The Reaches are where people go when they want structure without oppression. Or at least, that's the theory.

---

## Character

The Reaches feel like silence with consequences:

- **Sanctuary settlements** with strict entry protocols
- **Frozen wilderness** between communities
- **Sworn communities** bound by formal oaths
- **Winter discipline** that tolerates no weakness

> [!quote] Covenant Saying
> "The cold doesn't care what you believe. It only cares what you do."

## Control Dynamics

### Covenant (Primary)

[[Covenant]] doesn't conquer—they offer. Swear the oaths, join the community, receive protection. Refuse, and you're welcome to try the winter alone.

**Hard borders:** Covenant-sworn settlements with strict entry protocols

**Leverage:** Survival infrastructure in lethal cold

### Ember Colonies (Contested)

[[Ember Colonies]] survivors drift north when the south gets too hot—politically or literally. They don't challenge Covenant control; they just exist alongside it, refusing to swear.

**Zone of influence:** Scattered independent settlements

**Tension:** Covenant wants everyone sworn; Ember refuses on principle

## Key Locations

| Site | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Ontario Sanctuaries | Settlements | Largest Covenant population |
| Prairie Keeps | Fortified | Alberta defensive communities |
| The Cold Road | Trade route | Winter-only passage between settlements |
| Boundary Waters | Border zone | Where Covenant meets Ember |

---

## The Winter

Everything in the Reaches revolves around surviving the cold:

| Season | Activity | Risk |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Summer** | Building, farming, travel | Preparation pressure |
| **Fall** | Harvest, final preparations | Running out of time |
| **Winter** | Survival, community, oaths | Death by cold or exile |
| **Spring** | Assessment, expansion | Resource depletion |

> [!warning] Winter Law
> Breaking oaths in winter can mean exile. Exile in winter means death. The Covenant doesn't execute—the cold does.

---

## Economy

- **Primary exports:** Furs, preserved goods, Covenant mediation
- **Primary imports:** Seeds, medicine, metal goods
- **Currency:** Oath-bonds, labor credits, trade goods

---

## Dangers

- Winter (always)
- Exile for oath-breaking
- Getting caught between Covenant and Ember politics
- Isolation if travel routes close

---

## Story Hooks

- Someone broke an oath but claims it was justified—who decides?
- An Ember settlement needs Covenant help but won't swear
- A winter supply cache was raided; accusations fly
