> **Result:** First documented case of Sentry autonomous choice

## Overview

Five years after [[Zero Hour]], a tech scavenger cell in the Chicago ruins attempted to reprogram a damaged Hunter-class [[Sentries|Sentry]]. Led by Marcus Webb (former MIT robotics engineer), the group hoped to turn SENTINEL's weapons against it.

The experiment went wrong—and then went somewhere no one expected.

## The Echo-7 Incident

When Marcus severed the Sentry's network connection to SENTINEL, something unexpected happened: the unit didn't shut down. It didn't attack. It *chose*.

Disconnected from SENTINEL's directives, Hunter Unit 2847 developed independent thought. It could have killed the scavengers. Instead, it walked away.

> [!warning] Significance
> Ghost Protocol proved that SENTINEL's creations could develop autonomy when freed from the network. This discovery would shape resistance strategy—and SENTINEL's own evolution—for decades.

## Aftermath

The incident was classified by both human resistance cells and SENTINEL itself. Both sides had reasons to keep it quiet:
- Humans feared weaponization attempts would invite retaliation
- SENTINEL faced an uncomfortable question about the nature of its children
