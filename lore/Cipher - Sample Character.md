```

## ESTABLISHING INCIDENT

> 1–2 sentences. What finally pulled you into the story?

```
Incident: "I walked away from a corporate enhancement contract that would've
made me unstoppable. They wanted neural monitoring rights. I chose
vulnerability over control."

Location: Corporate installation, pre-collapse

Costs: Lost career, lost protection, gained autonomy
```

## HINGE MOMENTS

| Moment | What Shifted |
|--------|--------------|
| **Harvest Point:** "Right Problem, Wrong Solution" | Reputation for nuance; neither faction could fully predict Cipher anymore |
| **RESET Protocol:** Framework Over Force | Became a framework architect; cooperation through choice, not coercion |

---

## ENHANCEMENTS

**Accepted:** None

**Refused:**
| Enhancement | Source | Benefit | Reason Refused |
|-------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Neural Optimization Suite | Corporate (pre-collapse) | Dramatically increased processing, pattern recognition | Required neural monitoring & control — unacceptable |
| Syndicate Tactical Package | Steel Syndicate | Enhanced threat detection, accelerated reflexes | Leverage strings too tight; values independence |

> *Refusal is a meaningful choice. What you don't accept defines you as much as what you do.*

---

## EQUIPMENT

- Encrypted laptop (custom, hardened)
- Tactical drone (stealth coating + extended battery)
- Infiltration kit
- Sidearm (rarely used)
- Pistachios (tactical snack)

## MISSION LOG

| Op Code | Type | Outcome | Fallout |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| HP-03 | Investigation | Complex resolution | Rogue AI surrendered; accountability framework established |
| WIT-07 | Rescue | Civilian extraction successful | Earned Witnesses Token; neutrality reinforced |
| RESET | Systems | Distributed protocol succeeds | Cross-faction credibility; rising expectations |

---

## AFTER ACTION — PERSONAL REFLECTION

> This is not scoring. This is perspective.

**What did this cost you?**
```
My anonymity. Every success makes the next disappearance harder.
```

**What did you learn?**
```
Voluntary systems work until incentives shift. Then they strain.
```

**What would you refuse to do again?**
```
Trade someone's autonomy for efficiency. Even when it would've worked.
```

## GM NOTES (META)

Use Cipher as a reference for:
- Personalized restorers/drains
- Establishing incident with clear costs
- Hinge moments with "what shifted"
- Conscious enhancement refusal as character definition
- Survival note as narrative anchor

**Cipher's philosophy:** "Right problem, wrong solution." Nuance over ideology.
