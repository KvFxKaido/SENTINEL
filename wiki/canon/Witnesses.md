# Witnesses

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Observe history, avoid intervention.** Truth preserved is civilization possible. Truth weaponized is the Collapse repeated.

---

## Overview

The Witnesses remember what really happened. Oral histories in church basements. Written records in old courthouses. They preserve truth in a world where every faction rewrites history to serve its interests.

That makes them dangerous—and invaluable.

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[Sovereign South]] — Deep South (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana interior)

### Zones of Influence

- Archive sites with sworn keepers across multiple regions

### Contested Areas

- [[Sovereign South]] — With [[Covenant]] over sanctuary agreements

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Archive sites with sworn keepers
- **Philosophy:** The records must survive, even if the keepers don't

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Witness Principle
> "Everyone lies about the past. We remember."

**Legitimate fear:** Without accurate history, the same mistakes repeat forever
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Neutrality becomes complicity; observation becomes paralysis

### What They Get Right

- Truth is the foundation of trust
- Documentation prevents revisionism
- Someone must remember what actually happened

### Where They Go Wrong

- "Just recording" can enable atrocity
- Neutrality in the face of injustice isn't neutral
- Hoarding truth can be as harmful as suppressing it

## The Witness Oath

Witnesses swear to preserve and document, not to judge or intervene:

| Principle | Meaning | Tension |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Record** | Document what happens | Even atrocities? |
| **Preserve** | Protect archives at all costs | Even personal cost? |
| **Share** | Make truth available to those who seek it | Even dangerous truth? |
| **Abstain** | Never use information as leverage | Even to prevent harm? |

> [!question] The Witness Dilemma
> If you know something that could save lives but revealing it violates your oath of neutrality—what do you do?

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Covenant]] | Allied | Both value oaths and truth; sanctuary agreements |
| [[Nexus]] | Respectful | Both value records; different philosophies on use |
| [[Architects]] | Cooperative | Share interest in accurate pre-Collapse records |
| [[Ghost Networks]] | Tense | Ghosts hide; Witnesses reveal |

---

## Structure

- **Field witnesses** — Document events as they happen
- **Archivists** — Preserve and organize records
- **Keepers** — Defend archive sites
- **Speakers** — Share historical truth when requested

---

## Archives

Witness archives contain:

- **Pre-Collapse records** — Government, corporate, personal
- **Collapse documentation** — What actually happened, hour by hour
- **Post-Collapse histories** — Faction formation, conflicts, treaties
- **Personal testimonies** — Individual stories preserved

---

## Story Hooks

- A Witness knows something crucial but their oath prevents them from acting
- An archive is threatened—do others care enough to defend it?
- Someone wants specific records destroyed before they can be shared

---

## Character Reference

[[Cipher - Sample Character|Cipher]] has an **Allied** standing with Witnesses—earned their token through rescue and ethical transparency.
