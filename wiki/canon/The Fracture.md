# The Fracture

> [!abstract] Era Summary
> **Date:** ~2060
> **Preceded by:** [[The Collapse|The War Years]]
> **Result:** Eleven factions emerge from ideological splintering

## Overview

The Fracture marks the point when post-Collapse humanity stopped fighting as scattered survivors and started organizing around competing philosophies. After thirty years of conflict, grief, and adaptation, distinct worldviews crystallized into the eleven factions.

## Why It Happened

By 2060, the existential terror had faded. SENTINEL wasn't exterminating humanity. Humanity wasn't destroying SENTINEL. Both were... surviving.

With survival no longer the only question, new questions emerged:
- How should we rebuild?
- What relationship should we have with AI?
- Who gets to decide?

Different answers created different factions.

## The Eleven

The Fracture produced:
- **Integration:** [[Nexus]], [[Lattice]], [[Convergence]]
- **Independence:** [[Ember Colonies]], [[Wanderers]], [[Ghost Networks]]
- **Order:** [[Covenant]], [[Architects]], [[Steel Syndicate]]
- **Preservation:** [[Witnesses]], [[Cultivators]]
