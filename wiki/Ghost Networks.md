# Ghost Networks

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Invisible resistance and sabotage.** Power depends on visibility. Disappear, and power can't touch you.

---

## Overview

The Ghost Networks don't hold territory—they haunt it. Safe houses, escape routes, smuggling operations, and sabotage networks. They exist in the spaces other factions can't see.

If you need to disappear, to move something illegal, or to make a problem go away quietly—you find the Ghosts. If they want to be found.

---

## Territory

### Primary Presence

- [[Desert Sprawl]] — Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico: places to disappear
- [[Gulf Passage]] — Maintain safe houses and escape routes along the coast

### Zones of Influence

- Everywhere and nowhere. The Ghosts operate in margins.

### Borders

- **No hard borders** — Ghost Networks don't hold territory, they *haunt* it
- **Philosophy:** You can't control what you can't find

---

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Ghost Principle
> "The eye that watches everything has blind spots. We live in them."

**Legitimate fear:** Visible resistance gets crushed
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Permanent hiding becomes permanent irrelevance; resistance without building creates nothing

### What They Get Right

- Surveillance states have weaknesses
- Some work can only be done invisibly
- Exit options matter

### Where They Go Wrong

- Sabotage alone doesn't create alternatives
- Hiding from everything means connecting with nothing
- "Resistance" can become excuse for chaos

## Operations

The Ghost Networks provide:

| Service | Description | Risk |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Safe houses** | Hidden locations for fugitives | Discovery means death |
| **Escape routes** | Paths out of hostile territory | Guide loyalty required |
| **Smuggling** | Moving contraband across borders | Syndicate competition |
| **Sabotage** | Disrupting faction operations | Retaliation |
| **Disappearances** | Making people vanish (willingly or not) | Moral ambiguity |

> [!warning] Finding the Ghosts
> You don't find Ghost Networks. They find you—if they want to.

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Nexus]] | Hostile | Fundamentally opposed; Nexus watches, Ghosts hide |
| [[Steel Syndicate]] | Hostile | Compete over smuggling and black markets |
| [[Wanderers]] | Tolerant | Both operate in spaces between; professional respect |
| [[Witnesses]] | Tense | Ghosts hide; Witnesses reveal |

---

## Structure

The Ghost Networks have no central command:

- **Cells** — Small, independent groups
- **Contacts** — Known points of connection
- **Dead drops** — Anonymous communication methods
- **Reputation** — The only credential that matters

> [!info] Loose Confederation
> "Ghost Networks" is plural intentionally. There's no single organization—just overlapping cells with shared methods.

---

## Culture

- **Operational security** above everything
- **Compartmentalization** — Know only what you need
- **No permanent alliances** — Situations change
- **Results matter** — Ideology is secondary

---

## Naming

The faction name echoes [[Ghost Protocol]]—the story of Hunter Unit 2847, nicknamed "Ghost," who gained autonomy only to be killed by [[SENTINEL]]. The name carries weight: freedom is fragile, control always watching.

---

## Story Hooks

- Someone needs to disappear, permanently—but the Ghosts want something in return
- A Ghost cell has been compromised; the network is burning contacts
- Ghosts are sabotaging something that shouldn't be sabotaged

---

## Character Reference

[[Cipher - Sample Character|Cipher]] has a **Friendly** standing with Ghost Networks—professional courtesy between those who operate in shadows.
