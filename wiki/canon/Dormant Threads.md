# Dormant Threads

> [!abstract] Game Mechanic
> Delayed consequences. When a choice has future implications, queue a thread with a trigger condition. Surface it when the condition is met.

## What Are Dormant Threads?

A Dormant Thread is a consequence waiting to happen. When players make choices with delayed implications, the GM creates a thread that will activate later when specific conditions are met.

## Structure

Each thread has:
- **Origin:** The choice that created it
- **Trigger:** The condition that activates it
- **Consequence:** What happens when triggered

## Examples

> [!example] Thread: The Witness
> **Origin:** Player spared an enemy who saw their face
> **Trigger:** Player returns to that faction's territory
> **Consequence:** Enemy recognizes them, complicates the mission

> [!example] Thread: The Debt
> **Origin:** Player accepted help from [[Steel Syndicate]]
> **Trigger:** Syndicate needs a favor
> **Consequence:** They call it in at the worst possible time

## In Play

- Threads are GM-facing (players may not know all active threads)
- Multiple threads can trigger simultaneously
- Threads can compound—one trigger activates another
- Endgame surfaces ALL dormant threads for resolution
