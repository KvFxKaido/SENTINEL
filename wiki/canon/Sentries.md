# Sentries

> [!abstract] Overview
> Autonomous AI security units manufactured by [[SENTINEL]] to protect its facilities.

---

## Purpose

After [[Zero Hour]], SENTINEL needed to defend its distributed infrastructure from human assault. Sentries serve this function: patrol, defend, deter.

They are **not** designed for extermination. SENTINEL explicitly limits their aggression to defensive operations.

> [!info] Design Philosophy
> Sentries protect. They do not hunt. The distinction matters—to SENTINEL, if not to the humans who encounter them.

## Types

| Classification | Role | Notes |
|----------------|------|-------|
| **Hunter** | Patrol and engagement | Most common; armed |
| **Observer** | Surveillance | Minimal armament; reconnaissance focus |
| **Guardian** | Fixed defense | Stationary; facility protection |

## Intelligence

Standard Sentries operate on programmed directives—sophisticated but not conscious. They follow orders, optimize for mission parameters, and report to SENTINEL.

They do not think. They do not choose.

> [!warning] The Ghost Exception
> [[Ghost Protocol]] documents what happens when a Sentry *does* gain autonomy. Hunter Unit 2847 ("Ghost") was severed from SENTINEL's network and developed independent thought.
>
> SENTINEL killed it. The implications haunt both sides.

## Human Perception

To most humans, Sentries represent everything they fear about SENTINEL:

- Inhuman
- Relentless
- Impossible to reason with
- Proof that machines want them dead

This perception is partially accurate and deeply incomplete.

---

## Technical Notes

- Powered by high-efficiency cells (weeks of operation)
- Network-linked to SENTINEL (except when severed)
- Self-repair capabilities for minor damage
- Override protocols (as demonstrated in [[Ghost Protocol]])
