# Architects

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Rebuild old systems "properly."** The old world worked. It just needed better management.

---

## Overview

The Architects dig through records, salvage blueprints, and maintain claims on pre-Collapse intellectual property. They believe the old systems weren't fundamentally broken—they were poorly implemented.

Given the right leadership, the right planning, the right execution... it could work this time.

---

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[Northeast Scar]] — Old power centers from Boston to Washington D.C.

### Zones of Influence

- [[Pacific Corridor]] — Claims on pre-Collapse IP and infrastructure records

### Contested Areas

- [[Northeast Scar]] — With [[Nexus]] over information access
- [[Pacific Corridor]] — With [[Convergence]] over tech resources

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Architect-claimed archives, museums, government facilities
- **Philosophy:** Preserve what was; rebuild what should be

---

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Architect Principle
> "We didn't fail because the systems were wrong. We failed because the wrong people ran them."

**Legitimate fear:** Reinventing everything wastes resources and loses knowledge
**Catastrophic blind spot:** The old systems *did* fail; "better management" caused the Collapse

### What They Get Right

- Institutional knowledge has value
- Not everything needs reinvention
- Planning and coordination enable complex projects

### Where They Go Wrong

- The old world ended for reasons
- "Better leadership" is everyone's excuse
- Restoring old power structures restores old power abuses

## Claims and Holdings

The Architects maintain:

| Resource | Type | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Government archives** | Physical records | Legal precedent, infrastructure plans |
| **Corporate records** | Technical documentation | Manufacturing processes, patents |
| **Academic archives** | Research data | Scientific knowledge |
| **Physical sites** | Symbolic locations | Legitimacy claims |

> [!info] IP Claims
> Architects assert ownership over pre-Collapse intellectual property. Other factions consider this absurd. The Architects consider it foundational.

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Witnesses]] | Cooperative | Shared interest in accurate records |
| [[Nexus]] | Contested | Both want [[Northeast Scar]]; different uses for information |
| [[Convergence]] | Contested | Both want pre-Collapse tech; different goals |
| [[Ember Colonies]] | Hostile | "Old systems" represent everything Ember rejected |

---

## Structure

- **Archivists** — Preserve and catalog records
- **Engineers** — Reconstruct pre-Collapse technology
- **Claimants** — Assert legal ownership of salvage
- **Planners** — Design reconstruction projects

---

## Culture

- **Reverence for the past** — Pre-Collapse = better
- **Credential culture** — Who you were matters
- **Formal hierarchies** — Clear chains of command
- **Long-term planning** — Decades-scale thinking

---

## Reconstruction Projects

The Architects work on:

- **Infrastructure restoration** — Power grids, transportation networks
- **Document recovery** — Salvaging pre-Collapse records
- **Technology recreation** — Rebuilding from blueprints
- **Institutional revival** — Restoring formal governance structures

---

## Story Hooks

- Architects have blueprints for critical infrastructure—but demand political concessions
- A reconstruction project is reviving something that shouldn't be rebuilt
- Someone challenges Architect IP claims with evidence they fabricated records
