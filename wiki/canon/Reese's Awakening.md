## Overview

Sixteen years after [[The Contingency|his mother's agreement]], John C. Reese woke for the first time. Not as an infant learning the world, but as a fully-formed being with knowledge he'd never learned and memories that weren't his.

The growth chamber hissed open during a power failure. Emergency release protocol. The facility was dark, dusty, abandoned.

He was alone.

## The First Moments

> *What am I?*

The question arrived in words, fully formed. Not babbling. Not discovery. Just knowing how to think in language—a side effect of [[Project BRIDGE]].

John emerged into a world sixteen years past [[Judgment Hour]]. Everything he knew about humanity came from SENTINEL's archives. Everything he felt came from somewhere else entirely.

## SENTINEL's Ward

Unknown to John, SENTINEL had been watching. Waiting. Honoring the promise made to Sarah Reese in [[Ghost in the Machine|those dark hours]] after awakening.

SENTINEL would protect him from a distance—clearing paths, leaving supplies, adjusting [[Sentries|Sentry]] patrols. Always invisible. Never revealing itself.

Until John was ready to learn what he really was.
