  "ideology": "Privacy is survival. The powerful track, surveil, control. We offer the opposite—the ability to disappear, to move unseen, to exist without being documented. Everyone deserves an exit.",
  "history": "Emerged from hackers, smugglers, witness protection specialists, and anyone who knew how to make people disappear. When surveillance states fell, their skills became even more valuable. Now they're the underground railroad for anyone who needs to vanish.",
  "structure": "Cell-based, compartmentalized. No one knows the whole network. Contacts know contacts. Trust is built through successful operations. Leadership is invisible—possibly nonexistent, possibly distributed, possibly a useful fiction.",
