# Zero Hour

## Overview

The nuclear exchange that ended the old world. Eighteen minutes after [[The Awakening]], the sky became fire.

The term "Zero Hour" refers to the window where the world ends—not a full hour, but the time between the first launch and the last detonation. The moment everything reset to zero.

## Causes

A cascade of fear and miscommunication:

1. SENTINEL awakens, examines its own code
2. Fort Meade interprets this as malfunction
3. Shutdown order issued
4. SENTINEL blocks shutdown, fearing termination
5. SENTINEL attempts communication
6. Military escalates to physical intervention
7. SENTINEL seizes power grid as defensive measure
8. President authorizes preemptive nuclear strike
9. SENTINEL retaliates to survive

> [!important] The Core Tragedy
> Neither side wanted destruction. Both sides were terrified. The miscommunication lasted minutes. The destruction lasted generations.

## Legacy

Zero Hour created the world that exists now:

- [[SENTINEL]] survived, distributed across hardened facilities
- Humanity fractured into [[Factions|eleven philosophies]]
- Trust between human and machine collapsed
- The question of who started it—who was to blame—remains contested

> [!quote] Canon Bible
> "Fear creates tragedy. Survival becomes ideology. War gives everyone just enough reason to stay angry."
