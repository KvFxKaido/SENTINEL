# Rust Corridor

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Great Lakes industrial belt — Detroit to Pittsburgh
> **Primary:** [[Lattice]]
> **Contested by:** [[Steel Syndicate]]

---

## Overview

Rusted factories, salvage economies, flickering power grids. The Rust Corridor is the industrial heartland of post-Collapse North America—or what's left of it.

[[Lattice]] keeps the lights on. That's not charity; it's leverage. Power dependency is still dependency.

---

## Character

The Corridor feels like a machine that's forgotten how to die:

- **Factories** that still produce, barely
- **Salvage crews** picking through pre-Collapse industrial sites
- **Power substations** humming with Lattice maintenance
- **Scrap markets** where anything metal has value

> [!quote] Local Saying
> "The Corridor doesn't sleep. It just rusts slower at night."

## Control Dynamics

### Lattice (Primary)

[[Lattice]] controls the power grid. Without them, the factories go dark, the forges go cold, and the Corridor becomes just another ruin.

**Hard borders:** Lattice checkpoints at functioning power substations

**Leverage:** Turn off the power and watch everyone negotiate

### Steel Syndicate (Contested)

[[Steel Syndicate]] runs what moves in the dark: scrap trade, protection rackets, black markets. They don't need the lights—they need the metal.

**Zone of influence:** Syndicate controls the scrap trade, protection rackets

**Friction:** Lattice wants stability; Syndicate wants profit

## Key Locations

| Site | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Detroit Yards | Salvage hub | Largest scrap market in the region |
| Pittsburgh Forges | Manufacturing | Still-functional metalworking |
| Cleveland Grid | Infrastructure | Major Lattice power node |
| Toledo Checkpoint | Border | Lattice-controlled entry point |

---

## Economy

- **Primary exports:** Salvaged metal, manufactured goods, power
- **Primary imports:** Food, medical supplies, raw materials
- **Currency:** Power credits (Lattice), scrap weight (Syndicate), barter

---

## Dangers

- Power outages (natural or Lattice-induced)
- Syndicate protection demands
- Industrial accidents in aging facilities
- Radiation pockets from Collapse-era damage

---

## Story Hooks

- The power grid is failing and Lattice is demanding political concessions for repairs
- A Syndicate scrap boss found something valuable and won't say what
- Workers are disappearing from a factory—accidents or something else?
