# RESET Mission Module

> [!abstract] Document Type
> **Type:** Example mission template
> **Theme:** Centralized control vs. voluntary cooperation
> **Purpose:** Demonstrates SENTINEL's core gameplay themes

## Premise

A faction believes the only way to save civilization is to **manufacture a crisis** that forces everyone into coordinated control. Another path argues that **cooperation must remain voluntary** or it will always collapse.

The players uncover the truth, decide how to respond, and live with the consequences.

## Stakes

| Tension | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Control model | Centralized vs. Distributed |
| Trust basis | Coercion vs. Choice |
| Time horizon | Short-term safety vs. Long-term legitimacy |

> [!warning] No Default Victory
> There is no "correct" answer. Outcomes create new futures.

## The Engine

**RESET Protocol** is designed by people who genuinely want to prevent collapse. They're not villains—they're risk-intolerant pragmatists:
1. Map weaknesses
2. Trigger controlled disruptions
3. Rescue everyone
4. Become the mandatory coordinator

It works... until resentment fractures the world later.

**Voluntary coordination** is harder, slower, and morally cleaner. But only if it produces real results.
