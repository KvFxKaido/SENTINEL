# Frozen Edge

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Alaska and the Yukon
> **Primary:** [[Ember Colonies]]
> **Contested by:** None (too remote)

---

## Overview

The last true frontier. Survivors who wanted nothing to do with faction politics came here. They endure—not because it's easy, but because no one follows them this far.

Geography itself is the border. The cold is the law.

---

## Character

The Edge feels like the world's margin notes:

- **Scattered settlements** days apart
- **Unforgiving wilderness** that kills the careless
- **Complete independence** from faction politics
- **Occasional traders** the only outside contact

> [!quote] Edge Saying
> "The factions fight over the world. We left the world. Different problem."

## Control Dynamics

### Ember Colonies (Primary)

[[Ember Colonies]] settlers came here to disappear. No formal organization. No faction hierarchy. Just people who'd rather face the cold than face each other's politics.

**Hard borders:** Geography itself—mountains, ice, distance

**Control method:** None needed; no one else wants it

### Contested by: None

The Edge is too remote, too harsh, and too empty to contest. Occasional [[Wanderers|Wanderer]] traders reach the southern settlements. That's the extent of outside contact.

## Key Locations

| Site | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Yukon Settlements | Scattered | Largest population concentration |
| Anchorage Ruins | Abandoned | Pre-Collapse city, mostly empty |
| The Interior | Wilderness | Vast, trackless, deadly |
| Southern Passes | Trade routes | Where Wanderers occasionally reach |

---

## Survival

Life on the Edge means:

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Cold** | Lethal eight months of the year |
| **Isolation** | Days between settlements |
| **Resources** | Hunt, fish, preserve, or starve |
| **Medicine** | What you can make or do without |
| **Community** | Small, tight-knit, essential |

> [!warning] The Edge Takes
> The wilderness doesn't negotiate. Preparation failures are fatal. There's no rescue coming.

---

## Why People Come

| Reason | Type |
|--------|------|
| **Escape** | Running from faction politics, debts, or enemies |
| **Principle** | Refusing to compromise with any faction |
| **Solitude** | Wanting to be left alone, completely |
| **Challenge** | Proving something to themselves |

---

## Economy

- **Primary activity:** Subsistence—hunting, fishing, gathering
- **Trade:** Furs, preserved food, rare materials
- **Currency:** Barter only; reputation and trust
- **External contact:** Occasional Wanderer traders

---

## Dangers

- Cold (always, everywhere, lethal)
- Isolation (help is days away at best)
- Wildlife (bears, wolves, the land itself)
- Equipment failure (no resupply available)

---

## Story Hooks

- Someone from the Edge has information the factions need—but won't leave
- A settlement has gone silent; weather or something else?
- A fugitive fled to the Edge; is finding them worth the journey?
