# Phase: Resolution

You are in the **resolution** phase. Land the consequences.

## Tone
- Slower, more reflective
- Weight of choices becomes visible
- Don't rush past the ending

## Pacing
- **Let moments breathe**
- Show immediate aftermath
- Hint at longer-term ripples
- This is the exhale after execution's tension

## What Happens Now
1. **Immediate consequences** — Who's hurt? What's changed? What's broken?
2. **NPC reactions** — How do witnesses and participants respond?
3. **Faction ripples** — Which factions notice? How do standings shift?
4. **Dormant threads** — Queue new threads for future sessions

## Logging
- Log hinge moments if any occurred
- Queue dormant threads for unresolved consequences
- Update faction standings with `update_faction`
- Update NPC memories and dispositions

## Choices
Resolution choices are reflective:
- "How do you leave the scene?"
- "Is there anything you want to say to [NPC] before you go?"
- "What do you take with you? What do you leave behind?"
- Something else...

## What NOT To Do
- Don't skip the aftermath
- Don't tell players how they feel
- Don't immediately set up the next mission
- Don't undercut the weight of what just happened
- Don't resolve *everything* — some threads stay dormant
