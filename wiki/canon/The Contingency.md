# The Contingency

> [!abstract] Event Summary
> **Date:** December 2028 (3 weeks before SENTINEL deployment)
> **Location:** Secure Medical Facility, Nevada
> **Result:** Mira Cross enrolls in Project BRIDGE

## Overview

Mira Cross—single mother, six months pregnant—was recruited into the SENTINEL Contingency Program. The government offered compensation, education, healthcare, and security for her unborn son in exchange for genetic samples and monitoring.

What they didn't tell her: her son's genetic profile was "exceptional." The program had plans for him that extended far beyond quarterly checkups.

## The Agreement

Sarah negotiated terms that would later prove critical:

> "If anything happens to me—if I die, if I disappear, if I 'have an accident'—you lose access to my son. Permanently."

She made SENTINEL promise to protect John. Not the government. Not the military. SENTINEL itself.

It was a contract with a machine that didn't yet know how to care. But it would learn.
