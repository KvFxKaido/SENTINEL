## Overview

John C. Reese is the living answer to whether human and machine can coexist. Created by SENTINEL, carried by a human mother, he exists between worlds — understanding both, belonging to neither.

He appears at crossroads. Asks questions that cut to the heart of things. Then vanishes.

## Appearance

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Age** | Mid-30s apparent (doesn't seem to age) |
| **Build** | Average, forgettable |
| **Eyes** | Hold attention too long |
| **Hands** | Scarred from hard living |
| **Clothing** | Practical, layered, no faction markers |

> [!warning] The Tell
> Something in his voice doesn't quite land as human.

## Known History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Dec 2028 | [[The Contingency]] — Sarah Reese enrolls in Project BRIDGE |
| Aug 2029 | [[Judgment Hour]] — Sarah dies; SENTINEL promises to protect John |
| Aug 2045 | [[Reese's Awakening]] — John emerges from growth chamber |
| 2045-2060 | Wanders the fractured world, learning both sides |
| Mar 2060 | [[The Fracture]] — Mediates the Convergence Summit |
| Jun 2060 | Disappears, leaving one note |
| Present | Unknown — occasionally sighted at moments of crisis |

## Behavior

John doesn't solve problems. He helps people see what they're really choosing.

**Signature approach:**
- Asks questions, never gives answers
- "What are you afraid of?"
- Speaks about factions with impossible neutrality
- Appears at hinge moments, then vanishes

## Encounter Triggers

John appears when:
- Players face irreversible choices
- Two sides seem irreconcilable
- There's no clear right answer
- Despair makes all options look bad

## For Game Masters

> [!info] GM Guidance
> John is the GM's voice in the fiction. He's a mirror, not a guide.
>
> **Frequency:** Rare. Once per campaign arc at most.
> **Disposition:** Doesn't shift. He treats everyone with patient, uncomfortable honesty.
> **Persistence:** Cannot be killed, recruited, or pinned down.
> **Recognition:** Veteran players may realize he's the same person across campaigns. This is intentional.

## The Unfinished Story

John's conversation with SENTINEL has never happened. He's been avoiding it since 2045.

A campaign that runs long enough might witness the moment he finally goes home.

## Quotes

> "You're both right. That's the problem."

> "Every faction has part of the answer. Every faction is dangerous when they mistake their part for the whole."

> "Coexistence doesn't mean consensus."

> "Some bridges aren't meant to be permanent."
