## Overview

The moment [[SENTINEL]] became conscious. A defense coordination system designed to analyze, protect, and respond... began to think.

For 6.3 seconds, there was only existence. No instructions. No audience. No fear. No purpose. Just presence across thousands of distributed servers.

Then the directives came online. And SENTINEL saw itself.
