# Lattice

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Enhance humanity beyond weakness.** Evolution is too slow. Improvement is survival.

---

## Overview

Lattice believes humanity's limitations caused [[The Collapse]]. Fear, irrationality, slow reflexes—biological weakness created the conditions for catastrophe. Their solution: **transcend biology**.

They maintain power grids, run enhancement clinics, and offer upgrades that blur the line between human and machine. Where Lattice holds territory, the lights stay on.

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[Rust Corridor]] — Great Lakes industrial belt (Detroit to Pittsburgh)
- [[Pacific Corridor]] — Tech graveyards and enhancement clinics in former Silicon Valley

### Contested Areas

- [[Rust Corridor]] — With [[Steel Syndicate]] over scrap trade and resources
- [[Pacific Corridor]] — With [[Convergence]] over enhancement philosophy
- [[Texas Spine]] — Precarious power-sharing agreements with Syndicate

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Functioning power substations, Lattice checkpoints
- **Control method:** Infrastructure dependency—they keep the lights on

---

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Lattice Principle
> "The flesh failed us. We won't fail the flesh."

**Legitimate fear:** Human limitations will cause another collapse
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Enhancement becomes dependency; improvement becomes control

### What They Get Right

- Technology saved lives during and after the Collapse
- Human error contributed to catastrophe
- Medical enhancement reduces suffering

### Where They Go Wrong

- "Optimization" erases what makes humans human
- Dependency on Lattice infrastructure is still dependency
- Not everyone wants to be improved

## Enhancement Philosophy

Lattice offers a spectrum of modifications:

| Type | Examples | Trade-off |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Medical | Organ replacements, disease immunity | Maintenance dependency |
| Cognitive | Neural optimization, pattern recognition | Monitoring requirements |
| Physical | Enhanced reflexes, strength augmentation | Power requirements |
| Sensory | Low-light vision, expanded hearing | Sensory overload risk |

> [!warning] The Fine Print
> Most Lattice enhancements require ongoing maintenance, power, or updates. Independence has a price.

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Convergence]] | Allied but tense | Share tech base; disagree on consciousness upload |
| [[Steel Syndicate]] | Contested | Fight over [[Rust Corridor]] resources |
| [[Ember Colonies]] | Hostile | Represent opposite philosophies |
| [[Cultivators]] | Cold | "Natural" vs "enhanced" tension |

## Notable Elements

- **Enhancement clinics** offering upgrades at various price points
- **Power grid maintenance** as political leverage
- **Research into human-AI interfaces**
- **Quality-of-life improvements** that create dependency

---

## Story Hooks

- A Lattice enhancement is malfunctioning—and the fix requires accepting monitoring
- Someone is black-marketing unregulated enhancements with no safety protocols
- The power grid fails; Lattice wants something in exchange for restoration

---

## Character Reference

[[Cipher - Sample Character|Cipher]] refused Lattice's Neural Optimization Suite because it required neural monitoring rights—choosing vulnerability over control.
