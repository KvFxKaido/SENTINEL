# Steel Syndicate

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Resource control governs stability.** Someone has to keep things moving. It might as well be profitable.

---

## Overview

The Steel Syndicate turned scarcity into profit and hasn't stopped. They control oil infrastructure, weapons manufacturing, and the flow of resources across post-Collapse North America. Raw capitalism in a world with few rules.

They're not ideologues—they're pragmatists. Stability is good for business.

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[Texas Spine]] — Central Texas corridor (San Antonio to Dallas)

### Zones of Influence

- [[Rust Corridor]] — Control the scrap trade, protection rackets
- [[Desert Sprawl]] — Black market hubs in old casino towns

### Contested Areas

- [[Rust Corridor]] — With [[Lattice]] over industrial resources
- [[Texas Spine]] — Precarious power-sharing agreements with Lattice
- [[Desert Sprawl]] — With [[Ghost Networks]] over smuggling routes

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Syndicate-controlled refineries and trade posts
- **Control method:** Economic dependency—they control what moves

---

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Syndicate Principle
> "Everyone needs something. We make sure it has a price."

**Legitimate fear:** Chaos destroys markets; markets enable survival
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Profit becomes exploitation; stability becomes monopoly

### What They Get Right

- Resource distribution requires organization
- Economic incentives can align interests
- Someone has to make hard logistical decisions

### Where They Go Wrong

- "Fair price" is whatever they can extract
- Dependency is intentional
- "Stability" means Syndicate stability

## Operations

The Syndicate runs on **control points**:

| Resource | Control | Leverage |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Fuel** | Refineries, distribution | Transportation dependency |
| **Weapons** | Manufacturing, sales | Security dependency |
| **Scrap metal** | Collection, processing | Manufacturing dependency |
| **Protection** | Armed forces for hire | Physical security |

> [!warning] Syndicate Leverage
> They don't need to control everything. They need to control the things everyone else needs.

## Relations

| [[Wanderers]] | Wary | Syndicate wants trade control; Wanderers resist |
| [[Ghost Networks]] | Hostile | Compete over smuggling and black markets |
