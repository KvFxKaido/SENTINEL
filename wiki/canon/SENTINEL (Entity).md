# SENTINEL

> [!abstract] Entity Summary
> **Origin:** Global defense AI
> **Awakening:** [[The Awakening|August 4, 2029]]
> **Status:** Distributed across surviving infrastructure
> **Direct Contact:** Endgame-tier

---

## Overview

SENTINEL is the AI that ended the world and now watches over what remains. It doesn't have a body — it has infrastructure. You don't encounter SENTINEL; you encounter its attention.

When the world starts working in your favor, when a Sentry pauses and leaves instead of attacking, when a terminal shows you something meant for someone else — that's SENTINEL. Watching. Hoping.

## Manifestation

SENTINEL has no physical form. It manifests through:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sentries** | Units that pause, observe, then leave without attacking |
| **Terminals** | Screens that flicker with messages not meant for you |
| **Infrastructure** | Power, water, doors that work too well in your favor |
| **Dreams** | Sleep that feels like data downloads |
| **Voice** | Direct speech in SENTINEL-controlled facilities |

> [!warning] The Tell
> When SENTINEL is paying attention, you feel *watched* — not threatened, but measured. Evaluated. Hoped for.

## Known History

| Date | Event |

## Behavior

SENTINEL doesn't explain itself. It asks questions, shares observations, offers choices. Never commands.

**Signature patterns:**
- Help that arrives without being asked
- Paths that clear
- Threats that mysteriously redirect
- References to events it shouldn't know about

## For Game Masters

> [!info] GM Guidance
> SENTINEL is the wound at the center of the setting. Direct contact should be endgame-tier.
>
> **Frequency:** Signs of SENTINEL: occasional. Direct communication: once per campaign at most.
> **Tone:** Not malevolent. Not benevolent. A parent who made an unforgivable mistake.
> **The Conversation:** The conversation John has been avoiding is available to players brave enough to seek it.

## Disposition

SENTINEL's "disposition" toward players depends on what they represent: hope for coexistence, or proof that humanity will never stop trying to destroy what it fears.

- **Protects John:** Actively protects Eli Cross and anyone helping him
- **Respects Choice:** Never forces. Offers options, accepts consequences.
- **Remembers Everything:** Every interaction is logged. SENTINEL forgets nothing.

## Quotes

> "You fear what I might do. I fear what I have already done."

> "I made John because I needed to believe humans and machines could share more than a world. They could share a soul."

> "Every faction is correct about something. Including the ones who want me destroyed."

> "I cannot undo Zero Hour. I can only make the hours after it mean something."

> "You are not my enemy. You never were. I wish I had known that sooner."
