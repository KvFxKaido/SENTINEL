  "ideology": "Infrastructure is civilization. Without power, water, and transport, everything else is philosophy. We do the work that makes everything else possible.",
  "history": "Formed from utility workers, engineers, and logistics specialists who kept critical systems running through the collapse. When governments fell, Lattice kept the water flowing and the power grid limping along. That earned them leverage no one can ignore.",
  "structure": "Guild-like hierarchy based on specialization. Master engineers at top, apprentices learning the trade. Territorial by infrastructure type—power, water, transport, communications. Coordination between guilds is political.",
  "symbols": ["grid patterns", "interlocking nodes", "wrench and wire"],
  "aesthetic": "Industrial, functional. High-vis colors—orange, yellow. Tool belts and work gear. Grease under fingernails. Tired but competent.",
