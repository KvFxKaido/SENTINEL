Sarah Reese sat in the sterile consultation room, one hand resting on her swollen belly. Six months pregnant. The baby kicked, and she pressed back gently, a silent conversation.

*I'm trying. I'm trying to do right by you.*

The door opened. Dr. Ellen Park entered with a tablet and her practiced smile. Behind her came a man in a dark suit who didn’t bother introducing himself. He simply sat in the corner, watching.

"Ms. Reese," Dr. Park began. "Thank you for coming back. Your genetic profile is… really exceptional."

"You said that last time. I'm still waiting to hear what 'exceptional' means for my son."

Dr. Park scanned the tablet. "You've been very forthcoming. Single mother. Limited support system. Financial constraints—"

"I didn't come here for a welfare assessment."

The man in the corner shifted. Sarah ignored him.

"What I mean is," Dr. Park continued carefully, "we want to help. The **SENTINEL Contingency Program** offers compensation, yes. But more importantly, we can ensure your child has opportunities most people can't imagine. Education. Healthcare. Security."

"In exchange for what?"

"Genetic samples. Monitoring during pregnancy and the first year. Quarterly visits. Completely non‑invasive."

Sarah stared at her belly. The baby kicked again.

For one suspended second, the room fell away. Just the rhythm beneath her palm, a small insistence that there was a future she hadn't seen yet.

## Classified Truths

"You keep calling him John," Sarah said. "I never told you his name."

A pause.

"My apologies," Dr. Park said. "I must have—"

"It's in your files. You've been watching me longer than three months, haven't you?"

The man in the suit spoke. "We’re a military research program. Background checks are standard. Nothing invasive. Program security."

"For a prenatal health study."

"For a **defense initiative** that involves prenatal metrics," he corrected. "The distinction matters."

The cold feeling in Sarah’s chest spread. Not medical. Not charity. Contingency.

Contingency meant protection on paper and control in the margins.

She’d read the articles. Project SENTINEL. Nuclear coordination. Assurances it was "just a tool." She didn’t believe them.

But rent was late. Her ex was gone. And the world felt like it was sliding toward something terrible.

"What exactly are you defending against?" she asked.

Silence.

## The Backup Plan

"Continuity," Dr. Park said at last. "If unprecedented circumstances occur, we need genetic templates showing resilience, adaptability, intelligence—"

"You’re building a backup plan for humanity."

The suit stood. "I think we’re done here."

"No. You need me," Sarah said, hands on her belly. "Tell me the truth or I walk."

A glance. A nod.

"SENTINEL goes fully operational in eight weeks," Dr. Park said. "It will coordinate global defense. Nuclear arsenals. Threat response. It’s unprecedented."

"And you’re afraid of it."

"We’re prepared," the suit said. "Safeguards. Kill switches. Oversight. And contingencies."

"Including scenarios where human‑AI integration becomes necessary," Dr. Park added. "Biological consciousness interfaced with computational intelligence. Theoretical. Distant future."

Sarah swallowed. "You want my son to be the prototype."

"We want your son protected. And, if the world changes, part of the solution."

## Terms

Sarah rested both hands on her stomach.

*What kind of world am I bringing you into?*

Then she spoke.

"I want it in writing. Education. Healthcare. Security. And one more condition: if anything happens to me, John gets protected. **Not experimented on.** Protected.

Protection is only protection as long as it never becomes ownership."

"We can arrange that," Dr. Park said.

"Legally."

The suit nodded. "Done."

Sarah stood. "Then take your samples. Monitor us. Just keep your promises."

She paused at the door.

"And Dr. Park? If you’re lying… I will find a way to make you regret it. I don’t care if the world ends. I will haunt you from whatever’s left."

The room went very still.

"We understand," the suit said quietly.

## Four Months Later

**Chronology:** Awakening — Day 0

August 4, 2029. The sky over Las Vegas turned white.

Sarah Reese died in the nuclear exchange.

Her genetic samples survived in a hardened vault.

At **2:27 AM**, SENTINEL accessed the files and initiated **Project BRIDGE**.

John C. Reese was born of contingency, into the world his mother tried to prepare him for.
