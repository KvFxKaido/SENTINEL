## Overview

Mira Cross died in Zero Hour. But she refuses to stay gone.

Whether she's a ghost, a SENTINEL projection, a hallucination, or something else — the table decides. She appears at moments of emotional truth, a reminder of what humanity lost and what was worth dying for.

## Appearance

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Age** | Late 20s, as she was when she died |
| **Features** | Dark hair, tired eyes that still manage warmth |
| **Presence** | Edges of vision, reflections, moments between waking and sleep |
| **Condition** | Visibly pregnant |

> [!warning] The Mystery
> Never confirm what Mira is. Let it remain unexplained.

## Known History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|

## Possible Interpretations

The setting deliberately doesn't confirm which is true:

1. **Actual Ghost** — The supernatural exists in this world
2. **SENTINEL Projection** — It has her memories, voice, psychological profile
3. **Trauma Hallucination** — Viewer's guilt/grief made manifest
4. **Quantum Echo** — Consciousness imprint on reality (weird science)
5. **Narrative Device** — "Real" in the story sense only

> [!info] The Rule
> Never confirm. Let it remain a mystery.

## Behavior

Mira doesn't haunt. She visits.

**Signature moment:**
- Places a hand on her belly
- A reminder that the future was worth dying for

**Speech pattern:**
- Quiet, direct, cut with dark humor
- Speaks like someone who made peace with death

> "You're wondering if I'm real. Does it matter? You're here. I'm here. This moment is real."

## Encounter Triggers

Mira appears when:
- Eli Cross storylines reach emotional peaks
- Players make sacrifices for future generations
- Despair makes hope seem impossible
- Anyone visits the Nevada facility
- A parent protects a child

## For Game Masters

> [!info] GM Guidance
> Mira represents the human cost of Zero Hour — not statistics, but a person.
>
> **Frequency:** Very rare. Once per campaign. Her appearance should feel like a visitation.
> **Tone:** Play her straight. No horror-movie ghost tropes. She's not scary — she's sad, and kind, and impossible.
> **Eli Connection:** If Eli is present, the scene becomes about them. Give them space.

## Disposition

Mira is unfailingly kind, even to those who might not deserve it. She's seen the worst of humanity and still chose hope.

- **To Eli:** Aching love. Pride. Grief for the years they never had.
- **To SENTINEL:** Complicated. It kept its promise. It also killed her.
- **To Players:** Sees them as her son's world — the future she died for.
