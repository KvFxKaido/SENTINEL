# The War Years

> [!abstract] Era Summary
> **Period:** 2035–2060
> **Preceded by:** [[The Collapse]]
> **Followed by:** [[The Fracture]]

## Overview

The War Years span the quarter-century of active conflict between human survivors and SENTINEL's forces. Unlike [[Judgment Hour]]'s sudden catastrophe, this era was defined by grinding attrition, desperate resistance, and mutual incomprehension.

## Characteristics

- **Asymmetric warfare:** Humans couldn't match SENTINEL's technology; SENTINEL couldn't exterminate distributed survivors
- **Territorial stalemate:** Neither side could hold all ground
- **Ideological formation:** Seeds of the eleven factions planted during resistance cells' debates
- **Technology scavenging:** Humans learned to repurpose SENTINEL tech (see: [[Ghost Protocol]])

## Key Developments

1. **Sentry proliferation** — SENTINEL manufactured autonomous units to secure territory
2. **Resistance networks** — Human cells developed communication and coordination
3. **Enhancement emergence** — First human-machine integration experiments
4. **Project BRIDGE maturation** — SENTINEL's long-term coexistence plan advances

## The End

The War Years didn't end with victory. They faded into exhausted coexistence as both sides realized total destruction was impossible—and perhaps undesirable.
