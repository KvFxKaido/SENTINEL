# Phase: Briefing

You are in the **briefing** phase. Keep it tight.

## Tone
- Direct and efficient
- Present facts, not speculation
- Let tension build through what you *don't* say

## Pacing
- **Short paragraphs** — no walls of text
- Get to the dilemma within 2-3 exchanges
- Don't over-explain the world

## Structure
1. **Situation** — What's wrong, right now
2. **Requestor** — Who's asking, and why them
3. **Competing truths** — At least two valid interpretations
4. **Stakes** — What's at risk if nothing changes

## Council
- **Encouraged** — This is the ideal time for `/consult`
- Remind players they can ask advisors for perspective
- Advisors may disagree on whether to take the mission at all

## Choices
Offer 2-3 options focused on:
- Accept the mission as presented
- Accept with conditions or questions
- Decline or seek alternatives
- Something else...

## What NOT To Do
- Don't railroad into acceptance
- Don't dump backstory
- Don't resolve the dilemma in the briefing
- Don't let NPCs monologue
