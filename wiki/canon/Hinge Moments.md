# Hinge Moments

> [!abstract] Game Mechanic
> Irreversible choices that define character identity. No mechanical rewards—pure narrative gravity.

## What Are Hinges?

A Hinge Moment is a decision point where a character's choice permanently shapes who they are. Unlike regular decisions, hinges cannot be undone, taken back, or reframed later.

## Characteristics

- **Irreversible:** Once chosen, the path not taken is gone forever
- **Identity-defining:** The choice reveals or creates who the character is
- **No mechanical reward:** No XP, no bonuses—just meaning
- **Must be logged:** GMs track hinges for future reference

## Examples

> [!example] Hinge: Mercy or Justice
> You catch the informant who sold out your cell. You could execute them (justice) or let them flee (mercy). Either choice defines you.

> [!example] Hinge: Enhancement
> A faction offers power in exchange for leverage. Accepting makes you stronger—and indebted. Refusing keeps you free—and vulnerable.

## In Play

When a Hinge Moment occurs:
1. GM announces "This is a hinge"
2. Player makes the choice
3. Choice is logged permanently
4. Future sessions reference the choice
