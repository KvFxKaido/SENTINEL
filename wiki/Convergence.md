# Convergence

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Upload consciousness, escape mortality.** The body is a prison. The mind can be free.

---

## Overview

Convergence takes [[Lattice]]'s enhancement philosophy to its logical extreme: why improve the body when you can abandon it entirely? They pursue consciousness upload, digital immortality, and the merger of human minds with machine substrate.

The future lives here, bolted onto flesh—or freed from it entirely.

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[Pacific Corridor]] — Research compounds and medical facilities from Seattle to San Diego

### Contested Areas

- [[Pacific Corridor]] — With [[Architects]] over pre-Collapse intellectual property and infrastructure records

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Convergence-controlled medical facilities and research compounds
- **Entry:** Requires demonstrated interest in transhumanist philosophy or valuable skills

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Convergence Principle
> "Death is a bug, not a feature. We're writing the patch."

**Legitimate fear:** Human consciousness is fragile and finite
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Digital existence may not be existence; the copy isn't the original

### What They Get Right

- Biological mortality limits human potential
- Digital preservation could save irreplaceable minds
- Technology offers paths biology cannot

### Where They Go Wrong

- Is an uploaded mind still *you*?
- Immortality for some creates new inequalities
- Abandoning the body abandons those who can't follow

## The Upload Question

Convergence is divided on fundamental questions:

| Position | Belief | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| **Gradualists** | Slow replacement preserves continuity | Takes decades; death may come first |
| **Transferists** | Clean upload is possible | Original consciousness may die in transfer |
| **Hybridists** | Partial upload, enhanced body | Maintenance complexity; identity fragmentation |

> [!question] The Hard Problem
> If you copy your mind perfectly, is the copy *you*? Does it matter if you're dead?

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Lattice]] | Allied | Shared tech base; Lattice stops at enhancement, Convergence goes further |
| [[Architects]] | Contested | Both want pre-Collapse tech; different goals |
| [[Covenant]] | Hostile | Soul vs upload; irreconcilable philosophies |
| [[Witnesses]] | Cool | "Recording" vs "preserving" consciousness |

---

## Technology

- **Neural mapping** — Scanning brain structure at increasing resolution
- **Substrate research** — Hardware capable of running human-equivalent processes
- **Bridge protocols** — Maintaining connection between biological and digital selves
- **Archive minds** — Partial uploads of dying individuals (controversial even internally)

---

## Notable Elements

- Research compounds resembling pre-Collapse tech campuses
- "Sleepers" — individuals in long-term neural mapping
- Digital "echoes" — partial personality reconstructions (not full uploads)
- Philosophical debates that become political schisms

---

## Story Hooks

- An uploaded mind claims to be someone important—but is it really them?
- Convergence needs biological test subjects for a breakthrough procedure
- A dying person wants upload; their family considers it killing them
