# Cultivators

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Ecology-first restoration.** The land feeds us. We heal the land.

---

## Overview

The Collapse starved the cities. The Cultivators made sure it wouldn't happen again.

They reclaimed farmland, preserved seed vaults, and built agrarian communes focused on sustainable food production. In a world of scarcity, they control something everyone needs: **the ability to grow food**.

---

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[The Breadbasket]] — Great Plains (Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas)

### Zones of Influence

- [[Appalachian Hollows]] — Trade seeds and remedies along the ridgelines

### Contested Areas

- [[The Breadbasket]] — With [[Wanderers]] over trade route control (mostly cooperative)

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Defended granaries and water sources
- **Philosophy:** Protect the seeds, protect the future

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Cultivator Principle
> "You can't eat ideology. You can't burn food you don't have."

**Legitimate fear:** Ecological collapse will finish what the bombs started
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Purity becomes stagnation; sustainability becomes isolationism

### What They Get Right

- Food security is fundamental to everything else
- Ecological restoration enables long-term survival
- Patient, sustainable approaches outlast extraction

### Where They Go Wrong

- "Natural" isn't always better
- Refusing technology can cost lives
- Food as leverage is still leverage

## Agricultural Focus

The Cultivators preserve and develop:

| Resource | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Seed vaults** | Genetic diversity for future crops | Heavily defended |
| **Soil restoration** | Reversing contamination and depletion | Ongoing work |
| **Water management** | Irrigation without depletion | Regional priority |
| **Traditional knowledge** | Pre-industrial farming techniques | Actively taught |

> [!warning] The Seeds
> Cultivator seed vaults are among the most valuable—and most defended—resources in post-Collapse North America.

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Wanderers]] | Friendly | Run trade caravans carrying Cultivator goods |
| [[Ember Colonies]] | Friendly | Share seeds and remedies; aligned on self-sufficiency |
| [[Lattice]] | Cold | "Natural" vs "enhanced" philosophical tension |
| [[Steel Syndicate]] | Wary | Syndicate wants resource control; Cultivators resist |

---

## Culture

- **Seasonal rhythms** guide all activity
- **Seed-saving** as sacred responsibility
- **Community labor** for major agricultural work
- **Herbal medicine** alongside crop cultivation

---

## Notable Elements

- **Agrarian communes** with shared labor and resources
- **Seed exchanges** building genetic diversity
- **Restoration projects** healing contaminated land
- **Trade networks** for food distribution

---

## Story Hooks

- A seed vault has been contaminated—or stolen
- Cultivators are withholding food from a settlement for political reasons
- Someone claims to have seeds for a pre-Collapse crop everyone thought was extinct

## Character Reference

[[Cipher - Sample Character|Cipher]] has a **Friendly** standing with Cultivators—they were early adopters of Cipher's distributed frameworks.
