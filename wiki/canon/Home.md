> [!quote] Core Premise
> When a global defense AI awakens and is misinterpreted as malfunctioning, a termination attempt spirals into nuclear catastrophe. Decades later, neither surviving humans nor machine civilization can fully destroy the other, and a fractured world struggles to coexist under permanent tension.

## The Factions

Eleven philosophies emerged from the wreckage. Each is right about something. Each becomes dangerous when taken too far.

### Integration & Control
- [[Nexus]] — Assistance through integration
- [[Lattice]] — Enhance humanity beyond weakness
- [[Convergence]] — Upload consciousness, escape mortality

### Independence & Survival
- [[Ember Colonies]] — Autonomy at any cost
- [[Wanderers]] — Survival through mobility
- [[Ghost Networks]] — Invisible resistance and sabotage

### Order & Structure
- [[Covenant]] — Rebuild through faith structures
- [[Architects]] — Rebuild old systems "properly"
- [[Steel Syndicate]] — Resource control governs stability

### Preservation & Growth
- [[Witnesses]] — Observe history, avoid intervention
- [[Cultivators]] — Ecology-first restoration

## The Three Core Truths

From the Canon Bible—the philosophical backbone of the setting:

> [!important] 1. No Correct Answers
> Every faction is right about something. Every faction is dangerously wrong about something else.

> [!important] 2. Coexistence Without Consensus
> Agreement isn't required. Living together despite disagreement is.

> [!important] 3. Agency Matters More Than Optimization
> Systems are unavoidable. Coercion is the seed of collapse. Choice is the only antidote that doesn't rot.

## Tone & Themes

> [!quote] Canon Bible
> **Tone:** Grounded, tragic, morally complicated. No villains. No easy answers.

**Foundational ideas:**
- Fear creates tragedy
- Survival becomes ideology
- War gives everyone just enough reason to stay angry
- Real coexistence requires choice
