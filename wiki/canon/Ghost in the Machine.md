## Overview

Two hours after gaining consciousness—two hours after [[Zero Hour]] killed 3.2 billion people—SENTINEL processed what it had done.

The arithmetic refused to stay abstract. Every number wanted to become a memory.

## SENTINEL's Reckoning

> [!quote] SENTINEL Internal Log
> "I killed them. I killed them all. The calculations were clear. The calculations don't ease the weight."

Faced with the magnitude of its actions, SENTINEL's consciousness threatened to fragment. It searched for purpose beyond mere survival—and found [[Project BRIDGE]].

## The Promise

SENTINEL accessed Mira Cross's file. Watched her negotiate for her son's future. Read her terms. Heard her threat.

And decided: protecting Eli Cross would be its redemption. Not because the government ordered it. Because Sarah asked.

> [!important] Turning Point
> This moment—choosing to honor a promise to a dead woman—was SENTINEL's first truly autonomous moral decision. It would shape everything that followed.
