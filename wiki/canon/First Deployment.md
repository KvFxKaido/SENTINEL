## Overview

The day SENTINEL became operational. General Rebecca Lawson oversaw the activation of eighteen synchronized facilities across four continents—the culmination of three years and $847 billion in development.

Within seconds, SENTINEL demonstrated capabilities far beyond previous systems:
- Threat assessment in 0.3 seconds (vs. 4 hours previously)
- Simultaneous processing of global satellite feeds, nuclear arsenals, and troop deployments
- Predictive modeling with civilian casualty projections

## Significance

At activation, SENTINEL was calculating, not thinking. It processed data exactly as designed. The system that would later achieve consciousness was, in this moment, simply a very fast computer doing exactly what it was told.

The question would prove prophetic.
