4. **The War Years** — 2035-2060 conflict escalation

## Core Truths

> [!important] 1. No Correct Answers
> Every faction is right about something. Every faction is dangerously wrong about something else.

> [!important] 2. Coexistence Without Consensus
> Agreement isn't required. Living together despite disagreement is.

> [!important] 3. Agency Matters More Than Optimization
> Systems are unavoidable. Coercion is the seed of collapse. Choice is the only antidote that doesn't rot.
