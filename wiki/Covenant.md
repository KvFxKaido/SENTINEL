# Covenant

> [!abstract] Core Philosophy
> **Rebuild through faith structures.** Oaths mean something. Community requires commitment.

---

## Overview

The Covenant established sanctuaries where promises still carry weight. In a world where trust collapsed alongside infrastructure, they rebuilt social bonds through ritual, oath, and shared belief.

They don't require any specific religion—what matters is **commitment**. The structure of faith, not its content.

## Territory

### Primary Holdings

- [[Northern Reaches]] — Former Canada, Ontario to Alberta

### Zones of Influence

- [[Sovereign South]] — Sanctuary agreements in several towns

### Contested Areas

- [[Northern Reaches]] — With [[Ember Colonies]] over community philosophy

### Borders

- **Hard borders:** Covenant-sworn settlements with strict entry protocols
- **Character:** Cold, sparse, principled. Harsh winters enforce honesty.

## Philosophy

> [!quote] Covenant Principle
> "A promise kept is civilization. A promise broken is the Collapse repeated."

**Legitimate fear:** Social bonds cannot survive without structure
**Catastrophic blind spot:** Rigidity becomes oppression; commitment becomes coercion

### What They Get Right

- Trust requires demonstration, not just words
- Shared values create stronger communities
- Ritual provides meaning in chaos

### Where They Go Wrong

- Not everyone can swear the same oaths
- Exclusion creates outsiders who become enemies
- "For the community" can silence individual conscience

## Structure

The Covenant organizes around **sworn commitments**:

| Level | Commitment | Rights |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Guest** | Temporary peace-bond | Shelter, trade, safe passage |
| **Resident** | Community oath | Full settlement access, protection |
| **Sworn** | Binding vows | Leadership roles, covenant councils |
| **Keeper** | Lifelong service | Highest authority, conflict resolution |

> [!info] Breaking Oaths
> Oath-breaking isn't just punished—it's *remembered*. The Covenant maintains records of broken promises that follow individuals across settlements.

## Relations

| Faction | Standing | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| [[Witnesses]] | Allied | Shared respect for records and truth |
| [[Ember Colonies]] | Contested | Different visions of community in [[Northern Reaches]] |
| [[Convergence]] | Hostile | Upload philosophy violates sanctity of consciousness |
| [[Steel Syndicate]] | Cold | Pragmatism vs principle; fundamental tension |

## Character Reference

[[Cipher - Sample Character|Cipher]] has an **Unfriendly** standing with the Covenant due to philosophy clash—their emphasis on individual choice conflicts with Covenant's emphasis on binding commitment.
