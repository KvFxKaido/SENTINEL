# Appalachian Hollows

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Mountain communities from Georgia to Pennsylvania
> **Primary:** [[Ember Colonies]]
> **Contested by:** [[Cultivators]]

---

## Overview

Insular survivor settlements in valleys and old coal towns. The Hollows remember [[The Collapse]] viscerally—they lived it in these mountains while the cities burned below.

Outsiders earn trust slowly. Or not at all.

---

## Character

The Hollows feel like a place that's been holding its breath for sixty years:

- **Fortified hollers** with multiple fallback positions
- **Old coal towns** repurposed for survival
- **Mountain passes** that serve as natural chokepoints
- **Hidden caches** and escape routes known only to locals

> [!quote] Ember Saying
> "The mountains kept us alive. We keep the mountains secret."

## Control Dynamics

### Ember Colonies (Primary)

[[Ember Colonies]] don't rule the Hollows—they *are* the Hollows. These communities existed before the factions had names. They just kept surviving.

**Hard borders:** Mountain passes, fortified hollers, geography itself

**Philosophy:** If you can't find them, you can't control them

### Cultivators (Contested)

[[Cultivators]] trade along the ridgelines—seeds, remedies, agricultural knowledge. They're welcome because they're useful and don't try to stay.

**Zone of influence:** Trade routes, not territory

**Relationship:** Friendly commerce, not political alliance
