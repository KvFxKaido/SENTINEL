# Northeast Scar

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** Boston to Washington D.C.
> **Primary:** [[Architects]]
> **Contested by:** [[Nexus]]

---

## Overview

The old power centers, now crumbling monuments to what was. This was where pre-Collapse America governed itself—and where [[Judgment Hour]] hit hardest.

The Scar is archaeology with political implications. Every record recovered is a claim. Every ruin is someone's legitimacy.

---

## Character

The Scar feels like a museum that doesn't know it's dead:

- **Government ruins** — Capitol, Pentagon, monuments
- **University archives** — Research data, historical records
- **Corporate headquarters** — Pre-Collapse institutional knowledge
- **Surveillance infrastructure** — Still partially functional

> [!quote] Architect Saying
> "They built this to last forever. 'Forever' was shorter than they thought."

## Control Dynamics

### Architects (Primary)

[[Architects]] claim the Scar as their inheritance. They dig through records, assert IP rights, and plan reconstruction. The old world was theirs; they want it back.

**Hard borders:** Architect-claimed archives, museums, government facilities

**Leverage:** Legal and institutional records from before

### Nexus (Contested)

[[Nexus]] surveillance networks blanket the entire corridor. They don't claim territory—they claim information. Everything that happens in the Scar, Nexus knows.

**Zone of influence:** Surveillance networks, information brokers

**Conflict:** Architects want to control records; Nexus wants to watch everyone

## Key Locations

| Site | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| DC Ruins | Government | Capitol, monuments, federal archives |
| Boston Archives | Academic | University research data |
| Philadelphia Records | Historical | Constitutional documents, legal precedent |
| Baltimore Hub | Trade | Where Scar meets outside world |

---

## Archaeology

The Scar is being excavated—politically:

| Find | Claimant | Value |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Government records** | Architects | Legal authority claims |
| **Corporate archives** | Various | IP disputes, technical knowledge |
| **Military data** | Contested | Strategic intelligence |
| **Personal records** | Witnesses | Historical truth |

> [!important] The Record Wars
> Every document recovered is a potential weapon. Architects claim ownership. Nexus wants copies. Witnesses want preservation. Everyone has reasons to lie about what they found.

---

## Economy

- **Primary exports:** Recovered records, salvaged artifacts, legitimacy
- **Primary imports:** Food, labor, security
- **Currency:** Information, Architect credits, favors

---

## Dangers

- Radiation pockets (some areas still hot)
- Surveillance (Nexus sees everything)
- Political disputes over discoveries
- Structural collapse in unstable ruins

---

## Story Hooks

- A record has been found that contradicts official Architect history
- Nexus surveillance caught something they're not sharing
- Two factions claim the same archive; violence seems likely
