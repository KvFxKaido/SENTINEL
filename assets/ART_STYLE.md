# SENTINEL Visual House Style

Our art style is a synthesis of **post-collapse survivalist realism** with **tactical espionage drama**—built to feel grounded, tense, and morally complex. Every visual should carry the weight of choices made and consequences yet to come.

---

## Core Visual Philosophy

**MGS codec portraiture meets weathered post-collapse authenticity.** Characters are survivors first, icons second. Environments tell stories of what was lost and what endures. The aesthetic says: "This world broke, but people are still trying."

---

## Color Palette

### Base Layers (The Collapse)
- Ash Gray (#1A1A1A) — charred infrastructure, forgotten systems
- Dust Brown (#3D3229) — earth reclaiming concrete
- Oxidized Steel (#4A4F52) — decaying pre-collapse tech
- Worn Canvas (#5C5346) — survivor gear, makeshift shelters

### Faction Accent Colors

| Faction | Primary | Hex | Secondary | Usage |
|---------|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Nexus** | Data Blue | #00A8E8 | White glow | Surveillance, prediction overlays |
| **Ember Colonies** | Hearth Orange | #E85D04 | Warm amber | Fire, warmth, survival beacons |
| **Lattice** | Grid Yellow | #FFD000 | Copper | Power lines, infrastructure maps |
| **Convergence** | Integration Purple | #7B2CBF | Magenta pulse | Enhancement tech, bio-integration |
| **Covenant** | Oath White | #E8E8E8 | Silver | Clean lines, sanctuary markers |
| **Wanderers** | Trail Tan | #C9A227 | Dusty red | Trade routes, road markers |
| **Cultivators** | Growth Green | #2D6A4F | Brown earth | Crops, soil, seed storage |

| **Architects** | Blueprint Cyan | #0077B6 | Concrete gray | Pre-collapse schematics, credentials |
| **Ghost Networks** | Void Black | #0D0D0D | Pale flicker | Absence, negative space, erasure |

### Environmental Accents
- Rust Red (#8B3A3A) — decay, old blood, warning
- Moss Green (#4A5D23) — nature reclaiming, hope
- Smoke White (#C9C9C9) — ash, breath in cold air, spirits

---

## Lighting & Atmosphere

### Lighting Philosophy
- **Natural light dominates** — sun through broken windows, firelight, moonlight through gaps
- **Electric light is precious** — Lattice-controlled areas have steady glow; everywhere else, flickering or absent
- **Shadows tell stories** — what's hidden matters as much as what's shown

### Atmospheric Elements
- **Dust particles** in shafts of light (time passing, abandonment)
- **Smoke and steam** from cooking fires, breath, machinery
- **Weather as mood** — overcast for tension, rain for consequence, clear skies for rare hope
- **Fog at boundaries** — edges of known territory fade into uncertainty

### Faction-Specific Lighting
- **Nexus**: Cool blue data-glow, screens reflecting on faces
- **Ember**: Warm firelight, orange rim lighting
- **Lattice**: Steady artificial light, yellow-white industrial
- **Ghost Networks**: Darkness with occasional pale flicker

---

## Character Design

### Core Principles
- **Weathered authenticity** — gear is repaired, modified, layered
- **Function over fashion** — everything serves a purpose
- **History visible** — scars, patches, modifications tell backstory
- **Posture reveals role** — alert scouts, weary elders, calculating traders

### Faction Visual Language

| Faction | Silhouette | Materials | Details |
|---------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Nexus** | Sleek, sensors | Tech fabric, antenna rigs | Data overlays, eye augments |
| **Ember** | Layered, practical | Salvaged leather, wool | Fire-scarred, warm colors |
| **Lattice** | Utility, tools | Work gear, cables | Badges, tool belts |
| **Convergence** | Asymmetric, enhanced | Bio-tech integration | Visible augmentations |
| **Covenant** | Clean, formal | White/silver cloth | Oath marks, clean lines |
| **Wanderers** | Road-worn, mobile | Dust cloaks, packs | Route maps, trade tokens |
| **Cultivators** | Grounded, earthy | Natural fibers, soil-stained | Seed pouches, sun-weathered |
| **Steel Syndicate** | Sharp, guarded | Armor layers, hidden pockets | Leverage tokens, weapons |
| **Witnesses** | Archival, burdened | Document satchels, ink-stained | Record books, memory aids |
| **Architects** | Technical, precise | Pre-collapse uniforms (worn) | Credential badges, blueprints |
| **Ghost Networks** | Minimal, forgettable | Nondescript, changeable | Nothing identifying |

### Expression System (Codec Portraits)
- **Hostile**: Hard eyes, tight jaw, forward lean
- **Wary**: Narrowed eyes, slight frown, guarded posture
- **Neutral**: Even gaze, relaxed but alert
- **Warm**: Softened eyes, hint of smile, open posture
- **Loyal**: Direct eye contact, confident stance, protective lean

---

## Environmental Design

### Location Archetypes

**Ember Settlements**
- Repurposed pre-collapse structures (malls, schools, warehouses)
- Central fire pits, communal spaces
- Defensive perimeters, watch posts
- Warm interior lighting against cold exterior

**Lattice Infrastructure**
- Power stations, relay towers, cable runs
- Functional brutalism, yellow safety markings
- Steady lighting, humming machinery
- Clean compared to surroundings

**Nexus Observation Points**
- High vantage, antenna arrays
- Screens and data displays
- Cool blue glow, minimal furniture
- Everything positioned for surveillance

**Wanderer Routes**
- Trail markers, cache locations
- Temporary camps, fire circles
- Road signs repurposed, maps painted on surfaces
- Evidence of passage, not permanence

**Cultivator Territories**
- Terraced gardens, greenhouses, seed vaults
- Irrigation channels, composting areas
- Natural integration, structures half-buried
- Growth overtaking pre-collapse ruins

### Environmental Storytelling
- **What was here before** — pre-collapse signage, faded ads, old infrastructure
- **What happened** — damage patterns, burn marks, abandoned barricades
- **What survives** — repairs, modifications, new growth
- **What's contested** — overlapping faction markers, neutral zones, boundaries

## Typography & Graphic Elements

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Faction Names**: Bold condensed sans-serif (Oswald, Bebas Neue style)
- **NPC Names**: Clean humanist sans-serif (Source Sans, Open Sans style)
- **System Text**: Monospace for game mechanics (IBM Plex Mono style)
- **Lore Text**: Subtle serif for historical documents (Libre Baskerville style)

### Graphic Motifs

| Faction | Symbol Style | Recurring Elements |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Nexus** | Network nodes, eyes | Connection lines, data streams |
| **Ember** | Flame, hearth | Warmth gradients, smoke wisps |
| **Lattice** | Grid, power symbol | Circuit patterns, voltage marks |
| **Convergence** | Spiral, integration | Bio-tech fusion, asymmetry |
| **Covenant** | Shield, oath mark | Clean geometry, balanced |
| **Wanderers** | Path, compass rose | Direction arrows, distance marks |
| **Cultivators** | Seed, root system | Organic curves, growth patterns |
| **Steel Syndicate** | Scale, handshake | Sharp angles, hidden elements |
| **Witnesses** | Book, eye | Layered pages, ink marks |
| **Architects** | Blueprint grid, column | Technical precision, measurements |
| **Ghost Networks** | Absence, negative space | Fade effects, incomplete shapes |

### Codec Frame Elements
- Faction-colored borders
- Disposition indicators (color + icon)
- Scanline overlay for tension
- Name/title bar with clean typography

---

## Composition & Framing

### Portrait Composition (Codec Style)
- **Bust framing**: Chest up, face dominant
- **3/4 angle preferred**: Reveals character, suggests dimension
- **Eye-level or slight low angle**: Respect, not intimidation
- **Negative space on speaking side**: Room for dialogue

### Scene Composition
- **Foreground anchor**: Character or object grounds the viewer
- **Midground action**: Where the story happens
- **Background context**: Faction territory, environmental state
- **Light source motivation**: Every light has an in-world reason

### Tension vs. Resolution
- **Tension**: Off-center subjects, diagonal lines, cropped elements, shadows encroaching
- **Resolution**: Centered subjects, horizontal lines, full framing, light dominant

---

## Emotional Tone

### Core Emotional Registers

**Tension** (most scenes)
- Muted palette with single accent color
- Shadows active, light sources limited
- Characters alert, environment watchful

**Consequence** (after major choices)
- Heavier shadows, desaturated except for key elements
- Weather turning, light shifting
- Weight visible in posture

**Connection** (rare warmth)
- Warmer palette, firelight or sunlight
- Softer shadows, more visible faces
- Open postures, shared space

**Threat** (faction conflict, danger)
- High contrast, deep blacks
- Red/rust accents, sharp edges
- Aggressive angles, encroaching darkness

### What SENTINEL Visuals Are NOT
- **Not post-apocalyptic spectacle** — no wasteland warriors, no chrome and leather
- **Not grimdark nihilism** — darkness serves story, not aesthetic
- **Not clean dystopia** — nothing is sleek, everything is maintained
- **Not faction propaganda** — no heroes and villains, just people with agendas

## AI Image Generation

These prompts are tested with **Gemini (via NanoBanana)** but should work with any image generator. Adapt as needed for your tool of choice—the key is the explicit style anchor and guardrails.

### Style Anchor

> **Cinematic portrait, photorealistic digital art style. Modern post-apocalyptic cyberpunk aesthetic.**

This anchor prevents style drift toward fantasy, anime, or generic sci-fi. Reinforce with explicit negatives when needed.

### Portrait Prompt Template

```
Cinematic portrait, photorealistic digital art style.
Modern post-apocalyptic cyberpunk aesthetic. NOT fantasy, NOT medieval, NOT anime, NOT elf, NOT blue hair.
[PERSON_DESCRIPTOR] with [BUILD] build, [HAIR_DESCRIPTION], [EYE_DESCRIPTION], [FACIAL_FEATURES], [DISTINGUISHING_MARKS], [EXPRESSION].

High detail, dramatic rim lighting, shallow depth of field.
Bust framing, 3/4 angle, looking slightly off-camera.
```

### Person Descriptor Table

Explicit descriptors anchor generation. Vague terms cause drift.

| Skin Tone | Masculine | Feminine | Androgynous |

```

### Tips for Consistent Results

- **Use explicit negatives** — "NOT fantasy, NOT anime" prevents drift better than positive-only prompts
- **Anchor skin tone explicitly** — vague terms like "diverse" or "ethnic" produce inconsistent results
- **Include faction color twice** — in lighting AND gear description for strong visual coding
- **Keep expressions simple** — complex emotional descriptions confuse generators

---

This style makes SENTINEL instantly recognizable: **grounded, tense, faction-coded, and morally complex**—tactical espionage meets post-collapse survival meets the weight of every choice.
