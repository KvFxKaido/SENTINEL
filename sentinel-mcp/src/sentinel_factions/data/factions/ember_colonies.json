  "history": "Formed from the survivors who didn't wait for rescue. When the cities fell, small groups kept each other alive through mutual aid and stubborn refusal to die. They named themselves for the embers that remain after a fire—small, but capable of starting something new.",
  "structure": "Loose confederation of settlements. Each colony governs itself. Decisions made by those affected. No permanent leaders, only situational ones. Trust is earned through action, not title.",
  "symbols": ["◆", "ember/flame", "clasped hands", "seeds"],
  "aesthetic": "Repurposed, practical, human-scaled. Warm colors—amber, rust, earth tones. Handmade signs. Gardens everywhere. Noise and life.",
