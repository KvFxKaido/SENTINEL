# CIPHER DOSSIER — EXAMPLE TIMELINE (CASE STUDY)

> Reference character. Example outcomes from one timeline.
> **Not universal canon.** Other campaigns may diverge completely.

---

## 1) SNAPSHOT

**Role:** Independent systems analyst / crisis mediator
**Operating Mode:** Faction‑neutral consultant
**Strengths:** pattern recognition, negotiation under pressure, framework design
**Vulnerabilities:** social energy limits, non‑combatant risk, overthinking under stress
**Philosophy (short):** "Right problem, wrong solution." Nuance over ideology.

---

## 2) PLAY‑RELEVANT MECHANICS

**Background:** Intel Operative
**Core Expertise:** Systems Analysis (+5), Infrastructure Assessment, Stealth/Evasion
**Combat:** avoids direct conflict; favors drones, avoidance, and planning
**Social Energy Name:** Pistachios (custom track)
**Reset Ritual:** quiet work, headphones, tactical snack
**Trigger:** moral hypocrisy (+5% extra drain)
**Sanctuary:** quiet workspaces, server rooms

> Refuses all enhancements. Values autonomy over optimization.

---

## 3) RELATIONSHIP MAP (CURRENT TIMELINE)

### Allied

* **Steel Syndicate:** Trusted operator; repeated successful coordination.
* **Witnesses:** Earned token through rescue and ethical transparency.

### Friendly

* **Ember Colonies:** Resolved sabotage while acknowledging real vulnerabilities.
* **Cultivators:** Early adopters of distributed frameworks.
* **Wanderers:** Respect pragmatic security orientation.

### Complicated

* **Lattice:** Cooperation after preventing harmful protocol; mutual respect, mutual caution.

### Unknown

* **Nexus:** Little direct contact; wary interest both ways.

> Status may shift as decisions accumulate. Record changes, not predictions.

---

## 4) HINGE MOMENTS (SUMMARY)

**Harvest Point:** condemned coercive AI tactics while validating infrastructure risks.
**RESET Crisis:** chose voluntary cooperation frameworks over force or centralization.

Format memory cue:

> **Situation → Choice → Consequence**

## 5) MISSION LOG (ABBREVIATED)

| Mission        | Type          | Result                         | Reputation Impact            | Personal Cost       |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Harvest Point  | Investigation | AI accountability framework    | Mixed trust from Ember/Nexus | Heavy social drain  |
| Supply Run     | Rescue        | Civilian extraction negotiated | Witnesses Allied             | Minimal drain       |
| RESET Response | Systems       | Distributed protocol succeeds  | Cross‑faction credibility    | Rising expectations |

Full write‑ups live in Case File archives. This log stays brief.

## 6) STORY HOOKS

**Now:** Nexus Core negotiations; first true stress‑test of DSP; growing consultation burnout.
**Later:** attempts to weaponize frameworks; succession planning if Cipher goes offline.

---

## 7) LESSONS FOR GMs (META)

* Neutrality creates access *and* suspicion. Use both.
* Saying "no" to enhancements is a real cost that shapes play.
* Voluntary systems work until incentives shift. Then they strain.
* Consequences should echo socially, not just tactically.

---

## 8) ALTERNATE TIMELINE PROMPTS

If another table meets Cipher, consider:

* Cipher fails a negotiation and loses reputation to extremists.
* Cipher accepts a single enhancement and grapples with dependency.
* Cipher becomes a rival consultant whose priorities clash with the PCs.
* Cipher disappears, leaving frameworks no one fully understands.

> Case studies are teaching tools, not destiny maps.
