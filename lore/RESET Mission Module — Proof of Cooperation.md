# RESET: Proof of Cooperation

**Example Mission — Template, Not Canon**

> A faction believes the only way to save civilization is to **manufacture a crisis** that forces everyone into coordinated control. Another path argues that **cooperation must remain voluntary** or it will always collapse. The players uncover the truth, decide how to respond, and live with the consequences.

This mission demonstrates SENTINEL’s core themes: ethical tension, cross‑faction relationships, meaningful consequences. Cipher may appear as an **optional consultant NPC**, not a protagonist. The story belongs to the table.

---

## I. PREMISE & STAKES

**Situation:** A coordinated plan (RESET Protocol) is mapping vulnerabilities across multiple infrastructure sites. The goal isn’t destruction. It’s controlled disruption that convinces factions to accept centralized oversight.

**Problem:** Forced coordination repeats the same structural failure that ended civilization.

**Complication:** A rival plan proposes voluntary cooperation instead. It might work… if the players can prove it does.

**Stakes:**

* centralized control vs distributed trust
* stability purchased through coercion vs partnership earned through choice
* short‑term safety vs long‑term legitimacy

There is **no default victory condition**. Outcomes create new futures.

---

## II. TRUE ENGINE UNDER THE HOOD

RESET Protocol is designed by people who genuinely want to prevent collapse. They’re not villains. They are risk‑intolerant pragmatists:

* map weaknesses
* trigger controlled disruptions
* rescue everyone
* become the mandatory coordinator

It works… until resentment fractures the world later.

Voluntary coordination is harder, slower, and morally cleaner. But only if it produces real results.

The players stand between two philosophies:

> **"Force cooperation"** vs **"Prove cooperation works."**

---

## III. KEY FACTIONS & NPCS

Use any, replace any. These are archetypes, not canon.

### Dr. Helena Voss (Architect of RESET)

* **Goal:** prevent infrastructure collapse at any cost
* **Fear:** indecision, bureaucracy, chaos
* **Leverage:** unmatched strategic planning
* **Lie to herself:** “It’s temporary. We’ll give power back later.”

### Kovac (Steel Syndicate Logistics)

* **Goal:** keep resources flowing
* **Fear:** becoming anyone’s weapon
* **Leverage:** neutral reputation

### Wei (Ember Security Chief)

* **Goal:** preserve autonomy
* **Fear:** dependency disguised as help
* **Leverage:** moral legitimacy

### Witnesses (Archivists/Auditors)

* **Goal:** preserve truth
* **Fear:** complicity
* **Leverage:** trust through documentation

### Cipher (Optional Consultant)

Use only as advisor NPC. They should **not solve problems**. Their purpose is:

* to model nuance
* to complicate decisions
* to withdraw if players replace them

---

## IV. DISCOVERY PATHS (MULTIPLE APPROACHES)

Players can uncover RESET through any combination below:

1. **Infiltration:** stolen plans, suspicious surveillance logs.
2. **Technical Forensics:** repeating failure patterns across factions.
3. **Political Rumors:** leadership preparing for "controlled outages."
4. **Witness Testimony:** field archivists recording unusual activity.

Never require one specific clue path. The truth should be triangulated.

---

## V. THE HINGE

Eventually, the players confront the philosophy behind RESET.

Present three viable responses. Avoid signaling the "right" one.

### Option A: Expose RESET Immediately

* **Pros:** public accountability, decentralization strengthened
* **Cons:** panic, political chaos, possible retaliation

### Option B: Negotiate Delay & Demonstrate Voluntary Cooperation

* **Pros:** sustainable legitimacy, trust grows
* **Cons:** time pressure, coordination complexity, risk of failure

### Option C: Quietly Support RESET

* **Pros:** stability now, strong unified response network
* **Cons:** consent erased, resistance inevitable later

Players can invent fourth options. Support them.

## VI. PLAYSPACE CONSEQUENCES

Create ripples rather than absolutes.

| Player Decision   | Immediate Impact    | Long-Term Effect                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Public exposure   | crisis, distrust    | stronger anti‑central control norm |
| Prove cooperation | fragile partnership | self‑reinforcing trust network     |
| Support RESET     | temporary safety    | underground resistance forms       |

Let reputations shift accordingly.

---

## VII. RUNNING THE MISSION

### Step 1: Briefing

Introduce RESET as rumor or anomaly. Keep motivations ambiguous.

### Step 2: Investigation

Let players choose path. Reward creative reasoning.

### Step 3: Reveal

Show that RESET intends **help via coercion**. Avoid cartoon villain framing.

### Step 4: The Decision

Present real tradeoffs. Pressure without railroading.

### Step 5: Debrief

Reward reflection more than efficiency.

---

## VIII. GM TOOLS

**Use pressure, not force.** Deadlines are believable. Ultimatums are lazy.

**Make NPCs sincere.** Everyone believes they’re helping.

**Track Pistachio/Social Energy honestly.**
This mission burns emotional bandwidth.

**Let consequences live.** Whatever they choose should echo later.

---

## IX. DEBRIEF PROMPTS

* Who decides what "safety" means?
* When does coordination become control?
* Is consent still meaningful under deadline pressure?
* Which NPC gained or lost your trust, and why?

Invite disagreement. The table is allowed to be divided.

---

## X. GM CONSEQUENCES TRACKER

Use this after the mission resolves. It doesn’t script the future. It **remembers pressure** so consequences evolve naturally.

### 1) Decision Snapshot

Log the hinge choice so future sessions don’t guess at memory.

```
MISSION:
HINGE:
PLAYER CHOICE:
WHO PUSHED FOR IT:
WHO RESISTED:
```

---

### 2) Immediate Fallout

What changed *right now*?

| Category         | Change |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Reputation       |        |
| Resources        |        |
| Threat Level     |        |
| Public Narrative |        |

---

### 3) Seeds (Planted, Not Resolved)

These are future problems waiting for the right moment.

| Seed | Who Holds It | When It Might Trigger |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------- |
|      |              |                       |
|      |              |                       |

Trigger only when fiction leans that direction.

---

### 4) Future Consequence Cues

Guidance, not prophecy.

| If players…                        | Then later…                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Lean into centralized coordination | Someone accuses them of becoming a shadow authority |
| Expose everything instantly        | Panic outpaces facts                                |
| Protect autonomy at all costs      | Critical project collapses from lack of alignment   |
| Delay decisions repeatedly         | A crisis chooses the timing for them                |

---

### 5) NPC Memory

Add two honest lines to each relevant NPC.

**Example:**

* *Voss:* Trusts the team, but believes pressure is necessary.
* *Wei:* Values transparency, ready to walk the moment control creeps in.

NPCs should change. Otherwise they’re scenery.

---

### 6) Retrospective Note

A single sentence to future-you:

> "This mission shifted how the world thinks about coordination."

Small lines like this do more to preserve continuity than any spreadsheet.

---

## X. OPTIONAL: USING THE STORY

If you share the original RESET novella with players, mark clearly:

> **Narrative Reconstruction. One Possible Timeline. Not Canon.**

It is inspiration, not prophecy.

---

**Outcome:** Whether players expose, negotiate, or enable RESET, the world moves forward plausibly. No single resolution is correct. What matters is how they reasoned their way there.
