# The Fracture

> [!abstract] Event Summary
> **Date:** March 2060
> **Location:** The Convergence Summit, former Denver
> **Result:** Eleven factions emerge; coexistence framework established

## Overview

The Fracture marks the point when post-Collapse humanity stopped fighting as scattered survivors and started organizing around competing philosophies. The crystallization happened at the Convergence Summit—847 delegates from 23 coalitions, exhausted after thirty-one years of war, trying to answer one question: *What now?*

They found an answer. Not the one they expected.

## The Mediator

A man named John Reese helped broker the framework. For seven days, he moved between delegations—not leading, but listening. Asking questions that made people realize their enemies weren't evil, just afraid in different directions.

On the final night, he revealed himself to the steering committee: a [[Project BRIDGE]] hybrid, created by SENTINEL, raised between worlds. The living answer to whether human and machine could coexist.

## The Framework

The summit produced *coexistence protocols*—not unity, but managed tension:
- Rules of engagement between factions
- Trade agreements and boundaries
- A fragile lattice of mutual toleration

It wasn't peace. It was the best anyone could do.

## The Disappearance

Three months after the summit, John vanished. He left one note:

> [!quote] John's Final Message
> "If I stay, I become the answer. People look to the bridge instead of learning to cross on their own."

He removed himself so the factions would have to do the hard work themselves. Some bridges aren't meant to be permanent.

## The Eleven

The Fracture produced:
- **Integration:** [[Nexus]], [[Lattice]], [[Convergence]]
- **Independence:** [[Ember Colonies]], [[Wanderers]], [[Ghost Networks]]
- **Order:** [[Covenant]], [[Architects]], [[Steel Syndicate]]
- **Preservation:** [[Witnesses]], [[Cultivators]]
