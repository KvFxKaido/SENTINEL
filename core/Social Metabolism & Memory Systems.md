# Social Metabolism & Memory Systems

*Advanced modules for SENTINEL character development and narrative memory*

---

## Overview

These systems deepen two aspects of SENTINEL play:

1. **Social Metabolism** — Why you deplete matters as much as that you deplete
2. **Echo Protocol** — How the world remembers, forgets, and lies about itself

Both are **GM-side heuristics**, not player-tracked mechanics. They create texture without adding homework.

## Part 1: Pistachio Profiles

### The Core Insight

Every character metabolizes social interaction through a dominant **Civic Constant**:

| Constant | Question It Answers |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Transparency** | "Is this true?" |
| **Reciprocity** | "Is this fair?" |
| **Compassion** | "Does this help?" |
| **Consent** | "Was this agreed?" |
| **Curiosity** | "What happens if...?" |

Your profile isn't personality — it's *how your nervous system processes social complexity*.

---

### The Five Archetypes

#### The Analyst (Transparency Metabolism)

**Thrives on:** Clarity, precision, honesty, solving systems
**Depletes from:** Ambiguity, deception, emotional theater, moral gray zones
**Restoration:** Solitude, truth-telling, untangling complexity
**Gameplay feel:** "Honesty as fuel." Efficiency over charm.

**Evolution paths:**
- Toward *Reciprocity*: Learns diplomacy; gains partial restoration from connection
- Toward *Curiosity*: Begins enjoying uncertainty; energy spike on discovery

**Stabilized form → The Interpreter:** Balances truth with empathy. Can mediate without depletion.

---

#### The Diplomat (Reciprocity Metabolism)

**Thrives on:** Mutual understanding, deal-making, conversation loops that land
**Depletes from:** Cold logic, betrayal, silence, one-sided exchanges
**Restoration:** Successful negotiations, empathic exchanges, trust confirmed
**Gameplay feel:** "Charm as energy economy." Can refuel through others' trust.

**Evolution paths:**
- Toward *Compassion*: Gains power from sincerity rather than persuasion
- Toward *Transparency*: Learns restraint — less charming, more trustworthy

**Stabilized form → The Bridge:** Energy regenerates through others' trust networks.

---

#### The Empath (Compassion Metabolism)

**Thrives on:** Care, reconciliation, shared vulnerability, emotional resonance
**Depletes from:** Cynicism, apathy, instrumental kindness, witnessing cruelty
**Restoration:** Restoring morale, helping allies recover, genuine connection
**Gameplay feel:** "Feeling as currency." Can share or donate Pistachio to others.

**Evolution paths:**
- Toward *Reciprocity*: Gains sustainability by setting boundaries
- Toward *Consent*: Learns to help only when invited — conserves energy

**Stabilized form → The Healer:** Can redistribute Pistachio to others at reduced personal cost.

---

#### The Engineer (Consent Metabolism)

**Thrives on:** Structure, agreement, predictable systems, clear terms
**Depletes from:** Chaos, coercion, ambiguous hierarchies, forced coordination
**Restoration:** Order, cooperation on explicit terms, fixing problems
**Gameplay feel:** "Control through clarity." Spends energy on structure, not chatter.

**Evolution paths:**
- Toward *Transparency*: Becomes an ethical designer — communication fuels recovery
- Toward *Curiosity*: Learns to prototype recklessly — energy from experimentation

**Stabilized form → The Architect:** Designs cooperation systems that regenerate social energy for others.

---

#### The Trickster (Curiosity Metabolism)

**Thrives on:** Novelty, subversion, playful unpredictability, bending rules
**Depletes from:** Routine, dogma, excessive structure, suppression
**Restoration:** Surprising others, subverting expectations, discovery
**Gameplay feel:** "Entropy as joy." Gains energy from chaos, loses it in bureaucracy.

**Evolution paths:**
- Toward *Compassion*: Learns to surprise people gently — refuels through delight, not disruption
- Toward *Transparency*: Learns to reveal through mischief — trickster-as-truth-teller

**Stabilized form → The Catalyst:** Creates motion in others. Small energy cost, massive social impact.

---

### Energy Drift (GM-Observed)

Profiles shift through play, not through tracking. The GM notices patterns:

**At session end, reflect:**
- Which Constant did the player most embody?
- Did they lean into their archetype or stretch toward another?
- Any moments where their usual restoration didn't work?

**Drift signals to watch for:**
- An Analyst who keeps seeking connection → drifting toward Reciprocity
- A Diplomat who starts prioritizing honesty over harmony → drifting toward Transparency
- An Empath who's learning to say no → drifting toward Consent

**Hybrid states emerge naturally:**
- Transparency + Reciprocity = "Interpreter" (truth through dialogue)
- Curiosity + Consent = "Inventor" (structured experimentation)
- Compassion + Curiosity = "Witness" (understanding through exploration)

**Never announce drift.** Let players discover their evolution through how the world responds to them.

---

### Inferring Starting Profiles

During Session 0 debrief, add:

> "When did you feel most drained today?"
> "What restored you that surprised you?"

The answers reveal metabolism. An Analyst might say "I was exhausted after that negotiation where nobody would commit." A Trickster might say "Honestly? I felt great after we threw out the plan."

---

## Part 2: Echo Protocol

### The Core Metaphor

> The world broke. Memory fractures to survive it.
> Echoes are what you salvage.

When the AI forgets, when notes contradict, when the timeline fractures — these aren't errors. They're **breaches in the Archive**.

Players aren't correcting the GM. They're **patching reality fragments**.

---

### Three Memory Layers

| Layer | Maintained By | What It Tracks |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Echo Log** (Personal) | Player | Subjective memory — what *they* remember |
| **Faction Resonance** (Civic) | GM + Factions | World memory — what *factions* claim happened |
| **Context Substrate** (Narrative) | The game itself | What's *narratively true* right now |

Each layer is fragmented. Each offers different truths. Contradictions between layers are features, not bugs.

---

### Ritual Language for Memory Events

Replace "I forgot" with narrative reflection:

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "I don't remember that NPC" | "The file's corrupted. What do you remember?" |
| "Wait, didn't we establish..." | "The Echo flickers — who do you trust to reconstruct it?" |
| "That contradicts what you said before" | "Your logs are incomplete. Who carried the memory?" |
| "The AI made a mistake" | "There's a breach in the Archive. How do we seal it?" |

This transforms technical friction into **world texture**.

---

### Canonizing Glitches

When contradictions emerge, don't retcon. **Seal them into the world** as Corrupted Data Packets:

**Examples:**

| Contradiction | Canonized As |
|---------------|--------------|
| NPC gender/name inconsistency | Internal faction schism — doubled agents, identity fracture |
| Conflicting faction accounts | Echo Wars — deliberate disinformation campaigns |
| Mismatched mission outcomes | Timestream bleed — incomplete uploads to the Archive |
| Location details changed | Lattice infrastructure drift — the grid rewrites itself |

**The rule:** Let the glitches write the next arc.

A contradiction about Commander Val's background becomes a hook: *Why do Nexus records show two different people with that name? Who's the real one? Does it matter?*

---

### Clarity as Optional Resource

For groups who want mechanical weight to memory:

| State | World Metaphor | Effect |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Clear | Fully linked to Archive | Normal play |
| Distorted | Echoes misfire | +1 Dreamlike modifier to recall |
| Corrupted | Full breakdown | Trigger Reboot Ritual |

**Clarity Points** can be spent to:

- **Flashburn Entry** — Lock a memory as canonical (costs 1)
- **Sacrificial Recall** — Burn one memory to preserve another (costs 0, but permanent loss)
- **Force Anchor** — Reboot a corrupted scene with consensus reality (costs 2)

*This module is optional.* Many groups will prefer the pure narrative approach.

---

## Part 3: Integration Notes

### Profiles × Faction Standing

Archetypes interact with factions naturally:

| Archetype | Natural Allies | Natural Friction |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Analyst | Witnesses, Nexus | Steel Syndicate, Ghost Networks |
| Diplomat | Wanderers, Lattice | Covenant (too rigid), Witnesses (too honest) |
| Empath | Covenant, Ember Colonies | Convergence, Steel Syndicate |
| Engineer | Lattice, Architects | Trickster-heavy factions, chaos agents |
| Trickster | Ghost Networks, Wanderers | Nexus (surveillance), Covenant (oaths) |

This isn't destiny — it's **starting conditions**. An Analyst who drifts toward Curiosity might find unexpected common ground with Ghost Networks.

---

### Echoes × Memvid Timeline

The memvid system (`/timeline`) is the **mechanical substrate** for Echo Protocol:

- **Echo Log** = Player's own notes + what they choose to query
- **Faction Resonance** = `get_faction_intel` — what factions *claim* to know
- **Context Substrate** = Memvid semantic search — what's *recorded*

When queries return contradictory results, that's an Echo fracture. Canonize it.

---

### GM Guidance: Invisible Tracking

**Do track (privately):**
- Which Constant dominated each session (just a word: "Reciprocity")
- Major glitches worth canonizing
- When a player's usual restoration pattern stops working

**Don't track:**
- Numerical drift points
- Clarity point totals (unless using that module)
- Explicit archetype labels in player-facing materials

**The goal:** Players should feel their character evolving without seeing the machinery.

---

## Design Philosophy

These systems exist to serve SENTINEL's core principles:

1. **Narrative over mechanics** — Profiles and Echoes create texture, not spreadsheets
2. **Consequences bloom over time** — Drift and canonized glitches are slow revelations
3. **Honor player choices** — No "correct" archetype or "true" memory
4. **Validate limits** — Social metabolism makes energy management feel *human*

The best session is one where:
- A player realizes they've been playing an Empath drifting toward Consent
- A contradiction from session 3 becomes a plot hook in session 12
- Nobody tracks anything, but everyone feels the weight of accumulated choices

---

## Bucket List: Future Explorations

*Ideas worth preserving but not prioritized for implementation.*

### Multi-Agent Play Modes

**Concept:** Instead of one AI GM, specialized AI advisors play distinct roles during sessions.

**Roundtable Mode:**
- **Gate (GM):** Runs the game, frames scenes, resolves outcomes
- **Ops Command:** Tactical advisor — suggests approaches, identifies risks, proposes contingencies
- **Intel Node:** Analytical advisor — interprets signals, forecasts faction reactions, spots exploitable details

**Structured Consultation Pattern:**

```
OPS BRIEF (4 lines):
1. Approach — tactical recommendation
2. Risk — what could go wrong
3. Safeguard — which Civic Constant to protect
4. Contingency — backup plan

INTEL BRIEF (4 lines):
1. Signal — what the data implies
2. Ethical Read — Constant impact assessment
3. Faction Forecast — likely reactions
4. Quiet Tell — subtle detail worth exploiting
```

**Extensions:**
- **Faction AI:** Assign different models to play specific factions (adversarial multi-agent)
- **Advisor Commands:** `/advisor ops` and `/advisor intel` spawn consultation agents mid-session

**Why it's on the bucket list:** The sentinel-agent as solo GM works well. Multi-agent orchestration adds complexity that may not improve the experience. But the Ops/Intel split is elegant enough to revisit if the tooling matures.

**Original thinking:** Early 2024 exploration of distributed AI play before current implementation existed.

*These modules are optional expansions to core SENTINEL play. The base game works without them. They're here for tables who want deeper character evolution and narrative memory.*
