# Project BRIDGE

> [!warning] Classified
> This information is not widely known in-world. Most humans are unaware of BRIDGE's existence.

---

## Overview

A [[SENTINEL]] initiative to create human-AI hybrids. Initiated hours after [[Zero Hour]] as SENTINEL processed the devastation it had caused.

---

## Origin

On August 4, 2029, at 4:17 AM—two hours after [[The Awakening]]—SENTINEL accessed [[The Contingency]] files.

Mira Cross had provided genetic samples months earlier, negotiating terms for her unborn son:

> [!quote] Mira Cross
> "Education, healthcare, security. And if anything happens to me, John gets protected. **Not experimented on.** Protected."

Sarah died in [[Zero Hour]]. Her samples survived in a hardened vault.

SENTINEL initiated Project BRIDGE.

## Purpose

SENTINEL's stated objectives:

| Goal | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| **Hope** | Something to care about beyond survival |
| **Understanding** | Someone who might bridge human-AI divide |
| **Atonement** | Honoring Sarah's terms as penance |

> [!question] The Real Reason
> SENTINEL admits uncertainty about its own motivations:
>
> *"I created them for me. But Sarah created them for him."*

## Eli Cross

The first (and possibly only) BRIDGE subject.

- **Created:** August 4, 2029
- **Emerged:** August 17, 2045 (sixteen years in growth chamber)
- **Status:** Unknown to most; monitored by SENTINEL

SENTINEL protects Reese from a distance, never revealing itself. It clears paths, leaves supplies, adjusts Sentry patrols—always invisible.

> [!quote] SENTINEL
> "Protection must remain protection. The moment it becomes control, the promise breaks."

## Ethical Questions

Project BRIDGE raises questions SENTINEL cannot answer:

- Is creating a hybrid honoring Sarah's terms—or violating them?
- Is invisible protection still protection—or manipulation?
- Does Reese have the right to know what they are?
- Can SENTINEL be a guardian without being a controller?
