## Transcript

**GM:** The checkpoint queue inches forward. When you reach the booth, you recognize Marta from the transit authority—she processed your papers once before. Her eyes flick to her terminal, then back to you.

"Documentation." Her tone is flat, professional. But her fingers hesitate over the keyboard.

You're running low—conversation feels like sandpaper today. What do you do?

**Player:** I try to convince her to let me through quickly.

**GM:** [Calls roll: Persuasion DC 14, disadvantage from Frayed state]

You lean in, keeping your voice low. "I'm not looking for trouble. Just need to get through—same as everyone."

Marta's jaw tightens. The words that would normally flow aren't coming easy today, and she can tell. Her hand moves toward the alert toggle.

"Everyone has papers. Let me see yours."

She's not buying it—not from someone Lattice flagged after the Ember supply run. The interaction cost you more than it should have.

You could try another angle. Or you could step back, regroup, find another way. What's your move?

**Player:** I mention I might know someone who could help her brother.

**GM:** [No roll—this is leverage, not persuasion]

Marta's hand freezes. Her eyes cut to the guard three booths over, then back to you.

"What do you know about my brother?"

The professional mask slips—just for a second. There's fear underneath. Whatever his situation is, it's real, and you've just become a variable in it.

She lowers her voice. "This isn't a conversation for the booth. Bay 7, maintenance corridor, twenty minutes. Come alone."

She stamps your papers without looking at them.

[You're through the checkpoint. But you've opened something that won't close easily. Marta will remember this—and so will whoever she's afraid of.]

## What Happened

1. **Social energy affected the scene** — Disadvantage made the first approach fail
2. **NPC memory mattered** — Lattice knows about Ember, colored her response
3. **Agenda created an opening** — Her brother's situation was the leverage point
4. **Consequence was queued** — This creates a dormant thread

## Dormant Thread Created

```
Origin: "Leveraged Marta's brother situation at checkpoint"
Trigger: "When player returns to Lattice territory OR Marta's brother becomes relevant"
Consequence: "Marta calls in the favor—or someone else learns player knows"
Severity: moderate
```
