# Pacific Corridor

> [!abstract] Region Summary
> **Location:** West Coast — Seattle to San Diego
> **Primary:** [[Convergence]]
> **Contested by:** [[Architects]]

---

## Overview

Tech graveyards and enhancement clinics built in the bones of Silicon Valley. The future lives here, bolted onto flesh—or freed from it entirely.

The Corridor is where pre-Collapse technology concentration met post-Collapse desperation. What emerged is something new.

---

## Character

The Corridor feels like tomorrow refusing to wait:

- **Research compounds** resembling pre-Collapse tech campuses
- **Enhancement clinics** offering upgrades at various prices
- **Tech graveyards** picked over for salvageable components
- **Upload facilities** where consciousness meets silicon

## Control Dynamics

### Convergence (Primary)

[[Convergence]] controls the research facilities and enhancement clinics. They're building the future—specifically, a future where human minds don't need human bodies.

**Hard borders:** Convergence-controlled medical facilities and research compounds

**Entry:** Requires demonstrated interest or valuable skills

### Architects (Contested)

[[Architects]] maintain claims on pre-Collapse intellectual property and infrastructure records. They want the same technology but for restoration, not transcendence.

**Zone of influence:** Claims on pre-Collapse IP, old corporate facilities

**Conflict:** Different visions of what technology should do

## Key Locations

| Site | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Bay Archive | Research | Primary Convergence facility |
| Seattle Labs | Medical | Enhancement clinic hub |
| Valley Graveyards | Salvage | Pre-Collapse tech ruins |
| San Diego Compound | Upload | Consciousness transfer research |

---

## Technology

The Corridor is the most technologically advanced region:

| Category | Status | Access |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Medical enhancement** | Operational | Available for price/service |
| **Neural interfaces** | Experimental | Convergence members only |
| **Upload research** | Theoretical | Heavily restricted |
| **Salvaged tech** | Common | Trade goods |

> [!info] Enhancement Access
> Convergence doesn't hoard technology—they trade it. But the best enhancements come with strings attached.

---

## Economy

- **Primary exports:** Enhancements, medical services, salvaged tech
- **Primary imports:** Biological supplies, food, raw materials
- **Currency:** Tech credits, enhancement vouchers, research data

---

## Dangers

- Enhancement addiction or dependency
- Experimental procedure failures
- IP disputes with Architects
- Getting too deep into Convergence philosophy

---

## Story Hooks

- An enhancement is malfunctioning in ways that shouldn't be possible
- Architects claim Convergence stole critical pre-Collapse research
- Someone wants an upload but their family says it's murder
