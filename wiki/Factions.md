# The Factions

By 2060, the original binary of "Humans vs AI" collapsed into **eleven distinct philosophies**. Each emerged from trauma, each is right about something, and each becomes dangerous when taken too far.

> [!quote] Canon Bible
> These are not factions of "good vs evil." They are responses to trauma, each with legitimate fears and catastrophic blind spots.

## Faction Dynamics

No faction exists in isolation. Alliances shift, territories overlap, and philosophies clash.

### Common Tensions

- **Control vs Autonomy**: [[Nexus]] and [[Lattice]] vs [[Ember Colonies]] and [[Ghost Networks]]
- **Progress vs Preservation**: [[Convergence]] and [[Architects]] vs [[Witnesses]] and [[Cultivators]]
- **Pragmatism vs Principle**: [[Steel Syndicate]] vs [[Covenant]]

### Trading Relationships

The [[Wanderers]] connect isolated communities. The [[Steel Syndicate]] controls what moves in the dark. [[Cultivators]] trade seeds and remedies. Everyone needs something from someone.
