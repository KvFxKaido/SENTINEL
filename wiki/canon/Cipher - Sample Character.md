## BACKGROUND CLASSIFICATION

- [ ] Caretaker
- [ ] Survivor

- [ ] Technician
- [ ] Pilgrim
- [ ] Witness

Never stays anywhere long enough to become a target.
```

---

## ESTABLISHING INCIDENT

```
Incident: "I walked away from a corporate enhancement contract that would've
made me unstoppable. They wanted neural monitoring rights. I chose
vulnerability over control."

Location: Corporate installation, pre-collapse

Costs: Lost career, lost protection, gained autonomy
```

- Quiet environments
- Tactical planning
- Honest one-on-one conversations
- Clear objectives

**Drains:**
- Extended meetings
- Ideological debates
- Chaotic group dynamics
- Moral grandstanding
- Coercive negotiation

## HINGE MOMENTS

> [!hinge] Permanent events that define your story. No bonuses. Only consequences.

| Moment | What Shifted |
|--------|--------------|
| **Harvest Point:** "Right Problem, Wrong Solution" | Reputation for nuance; neither faction could fully predict Cipher anymore |
| **RESET Protocol:** Framework Over Force | Became a framework architect; cooperation through choice, not coercion |

---

## ENHANCEMENTS

**Accepted:** None

**Refused:**

| Enhancement | Source | Benefit | Reason Refused |
|-------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Neural Optimization Suite | Corporate (pre-collapse) | Dramatically increased processing, pattern recognition | Required neural monitoring & control — unacceptable |
| Syndicate Tactical Package | [[Steel Syndicate]] | Enhanced threat detection, accelerated reflexes | Leverage strings too tight; values independence |

> *Refusal is a meaningful choice. What you don't accept defines you as much as what you do.*

---

## EQUIPMENT

- Encrypted laptop (custom, hardened)
- Tactical drone (stealth coating + extended battery)
- Infiltration kit
- Sidearm (rarely used)
- Pistachios (tactical snack)

---

## MISSION LOG

| Op Code | Type | Outcome | Fallout |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| HP-03 | Investigation | Complex resolution | Rogue AI surrendered; accountability framework established |
| WIT-07 | Rescue | Civilian extraction successful | Earned [[Witnesses]] Token; neutrality reinforced |
| RESET | Systems | Distributed protocol succeeds | Cross-faction credibility; rising expectations |

---

## AFTER ACTION — PERSONAL REFLECTION

> [!reflection] This is not scoring. This is perspective.

**What did this cost you?**
```
My anonymity. Every success makes the next disappearance harder.
```

**What did you learn?**
```
Voluntary systems work until incentives shift. Then they strain.
```

**What would you refuse to do again?**
```
Trade someone's autonomy for efficiency. Even when it would've worked.
```
